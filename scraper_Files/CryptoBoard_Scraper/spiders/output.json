President Joe Biden nominated Barr to the role of vice chair for supervision of the Federal Reserve in April owing to his career in consumer protection and his role in shaping the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act following the 2008 financial crisis. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Barr, once pegged to serve as comptroller of the currency, was also a top Treasury Department official during former President Barack Obama’s administration. He secured a 66-28 vote by the Senate, exceeding the simple majority of 50 votes required for confirmation. “Today’s confirmation of Michael Barr as Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve is important progress for my plan to tackle inflation and for sound oversight as we transition to steady and stable growth,” Biden said in a statement . Loading Tweet.. In 2015, Barr became an advisor to Ripple Labs — which is at the center of a major lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission that argues the company sold XRP tokens worth $1.3 billion as unregistered securities. He’s no longer listed as an advisor, and it isn’t clear when he left as he hasn’t listed professional experiences on LinkedIn . Ripple didn’t respond to Blockworks’ request for comment by press time. In any case, the Fed will now have a full board for the first time since 2013, at a time when the US tackles its worst inflation in 40 years. Barr’s role had been vacant since late 2021 after Fed governor Randal Quarles stepped down in October. As a US central bank supervisor, Barr is expected to scale daily oversight of both the biggest lenders and smaller financial firms that play a part in the overall economy. He’ll also be in charge of developing regulatory policies for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which have been priorities for the Biden administration. The Fed’s chairman Jerome Powell said last year that he would accept the authority of the person in the supervision role as it is “charged with setting the regulatory agenda.” Barr, who joins the Fed from the University of Michigan’s Gerald F. Ford School of Public Policy, said in a May hearing that he’s committed to softening inflation to the Fed’s 2% target and ensuring the financial system is “robust and resilient.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

With retail and institutional players’ shaken confidence — spurred on by the kerfuffle in crypto lending  — deploying capital when uncertainty looms is not without inherent risks. Regulation promises to tighten controls over how crypto capital is utilized, engaged with and deployed, though more work needs to be done to protect investors, according to some . Viewing through a global macroeconomic lens also highlights less promising signs of an early recovery in the broader markets, namely equities, which have oftentimes been closely correlated to crypto. Global food shortage concerns resulting from the pandemic — exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — as well as rising inflation alongside central banks’ levering of interest rates to combat it, has all but increased the case for a “risk-off” environment. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Indeed, investment in crypto’s capital market has slowed — money that had once flowed freely into budding projects over the last few quarters slowed up during Q2. Though to some, like Stan Miroshnik, partner at mid-to-late stage digital equity firm focused on digital assets 10T Holdings, the market is still full of “unique opportunities” for investors. “We’re just now starting to see interesting deals come back into the market at more reasonable valuations,” Miroshnik told Blockworks in an interview. Others in the capital investment sector for crypto have also ramped up efforts to scoop up or further companies’ efforts seeking to build Web3 and DeFi (decentralized finance) infrastructure amid bear market conditions in hopes of snagging greater profits during better times. Crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital , which has backed multiple Web3 and decentralized finance projects, announced earlier this month it would be pouring an additional $430 million into crypto startups. Continuing that trend, early-stage investment firm Konvoy Ventures rolled out a $150 million fund aimed at budding gaming companies focused on a number of verticals including Web3, while the venture capital and incubation arm of Binance closed its $500 million fund early in June. Most venture capital firms and funds are betting big on the internet’s transition to a more decentralized and democratized version in information sharing and engagement including the tools and infrastructure decentralized finance is promising for that transition. Discussion from those developing those key infrastructure rails in the industry now centers around building atop of a less-than-frothy market following the contagion turmoil from crypto lenders caught up in Singapore-based hedge fund Three Arrows Capital ‘s implosion. Turning a threat into an opportunity “Every time there is a significant event, you watch and learn,” Bette Chen, co-founder of DeFi layer-1 smart contract platform Acala, told Blockworks. “This is a moment where you can see problems being exposed and for builders, those are actually opportunities where you can build strong systems.” It’s companies like Acala that are continuing to improve the industry’s shortcomings that Miroshnik and others like him are mostly interested in. The 10T co-founder said his fund was watching many blue-chip names including the likes of Fireblocks, OpenSea, Dapper Labs, Alchemy and Chainalysis which, in his opinion, had previously been too expensive on a multiple earnings basis where they had been trading 50 times the companies’ total revenue. “Now those valuations are coming down in the secondary market. And so in theory, one could buy some of those blue-chip names at more reasonable valuations,” he said. 10T, like other funds in the industry, approach their investment thesis by deploying capital across four verticals including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and metaverses, DeFi infrastructure, gateways such as wallets and exchanges, as well as businesses utilizing a token incentive engine for real-world use cases like those seen in decentralized wireless network Helium . When asked about the fund’s short-to-midterm outlook, Miroshnik said “money’s in the waiting, not the trading” providing somewhat sage advice for retail and institutional investors seeking to follow in lockstep the capital deployment of some of the industry’s bigger funds. “If you want to go deeper, and you want to make these vertical bets, they’re clear leaders already,” the co-founder said. “You don’t have to buy the new GameFi tokens. Ideally, you can just buy something where you know there’s a lot of momentum already.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "url": "https://blockworks.co/news/the-investors-guide-to-navigating-impermanent-loss",
        "text": "Investors often claim that you can’t see the full damage of impermanent loss until funds are withdrawn. According to the experts at Amberdata though, this isn’t the case. All data is open and measurable. Anyone can provide an estimate. The real challenge is finding a precise calculation and in analyzing the risk of impermanent loss versus the reward of transaction fees. The complexity of data sources makes this analysis difficult to account for all investment strategies. But a review of the basics can provide the tools necessary for such a report. We sat down with Amberdata , a leader in cryptoeconomic data, to better understand impermanent loss (IL) and how to navigate it. This guide will offer context to IL by explaining the technology behind automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pools. It will explain why it happens and why it is difficult to assess. And it will detail the data resources needed to detect clues before loss occurs. When does impermanent loss happen? Impermanent loss happens when the price of a token changes relative to its pair, between the time you deposit it in a liquidity pool and when you withdraw it. Think of it as primarily an unrealized opportunity cost. It’s not a real loss, because the loss is measured against the value your investment would have been if the tokens were held outside of the liquidity pool. So if you are measuring your investment in cash, impermanent loss may not cause you to lose money. And it’s unrealized because token pairs can return to the same ratio before liquidity is withdrawn. Where does it occur? Impermanent loss can occur in any decentralized exchange (DEX) that uses liquidity providers to fund pools segregated by trading pairs. But before we explain the mathematical phenomenon of the loss, we need to explain the purpose behind this new type of exchange and how it works. Decentralized Exchanges The purpose DEXs were created for people to swap different tokens without a trusted third party. Unlike a centralized exchange (CEX), assets remain in your wallet and the exchange never has custody of them. They use two blockchain-based innovations to maintain decentralization: automated market maker algorithms and liquidity pools. Automated Market Maker Algorithms An automated market maker algorithm is what sets the exchange rates for specific asset pairs within a DEX. The traditional CEXs facilitate trades through an order book. Exchange rates are set when buyers create demand and sellers offer supply. The order book matches the price a buyer is willing to pay with the price a seller is willing to accept. In contrast to setting prices to match buy and sell orders, AMM algorithms are programmed to automatically adjust exchange rates to keep the supply of paired tokens balanced within a pool. Liquidity Pools Liquidity pools are smart contract enforced deposits of two tokens needed to enable swaps on a DEX. These pairs are usually set at a 50/50 ratio (but there are also uneven liquidity pools). How they work Imagine that you are a brand new exchange looking to open a single pool for BTC and ETH. Before anyone is able to swap BTC for ETH or vice versa, you need to attract liquidity providers to the pool. The liquidity provider Exchanges do this by first charging a fee for every swap and then sharing those fees as rewards with all liquidity providers in the pool. For example, if you provide 1% of the liquidity in a pool, you’ll receive 1% of the fees for that pool. Understanding the fee structure is critical to assessing the risk vs reward of adding liquidity. Because ultimately, the rewards from fees could more than offset the risk of impermanent loss. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe In the ETH/BTC pool, a liquidity provider would need to include both tokens in their deposit. Most exchanges require a 1:1 ratio. So if a liquidity provider deposited 2 BTC and 1 BTC = 5 ETH, then you would need to match your BTC with 10 ETH. Once funds are deposited, you are given LP tokens as a representation of your percentage of the combined value of both tokens in the pool. LP tokens earn rewards from transaction fees and can be used to farm yield outside of the protocol. The trader Now that you have attracted enough liquidity providers, traders can start swapping tokens. But unlike CEXs, traders can’t toggle between their preferred token or currency in a single pool. Instead, they are required to swap one token for the other. So everytime BTC is withdrawn, the equivalent in exchange rate value is added in ETH — and vice versa. How AMMs price tokens and balance liquidity pool s At a pool’s onset, AMMs use market rates to set prices and an equal balance in value between the supply of both tokens. So if 1 BTC = 5 ETH, total supply in the pool will reflect that ratio. As users swap tokens, the AMM uses a mathematic formula to adjust prices and balance the liquidity pool. For example, say that there was initially 100 BTC and 500 ETH in the pool. The current price of BTC would therefore be 5 ETH. If you were to take 1 BTC for 5 ETH, the total supply would be 99 BTC and 505 ETH. This would change the price of BTC from 5 ETH to about 5.1 ETH. But say market-wide, the price of BTC is still 5 ETH. Arbitrage traders would then take that opportunity to buy BTC at a discount and sell it for ETH in the liquidity pool. This arbitrage would continue until the price falls back to market rates. Examples of impermanent loss The ultimate cause of impermanent loss is unequal price changes. Though, it is important to remember that your return is calculated after collecting fees. So even if unequal price fluctuations cause impermanent loss, you may still be able to make a profit if rewards from transaction fees cover the difference. For example, let’s say an ETH/BTC pool is programmed to keep the value of both baskets set at a 1:1 ratio. Meaning, the value of all BTC should be the same as all ETH. At the time of your deposit, 1 BTC equals 10 ETH across most other exchanges, so you deposit 4 BTC and 40 ETH. At the time of depositing the tokens, the size of the pool was 20 BTC and 200 ETH, so your total share of liquidity is 20%. A month later, ETH doubled in value while BTC’s price stayed the same. But the value of both token baskets in the pool don’t yet reflect the ETH market-wide price of .2 BTC. So arbitrage traders rush in to buy ETH at the discount until the pool ratio and token prices match the market rate. So once the pool supply reaches 20 BTC and 100 ETH, your 20% deposit will be worth 4 BTC and 20 ETH. That is a 20 ETH price difference from the initial 40 ETH deposit, resulting in an impermanent loss of 20 ETH. But it just so happened that transaction fees were extraordinarily high, providing an additional 10 ETH to your share of the pool. In this case, the loss on your return would only be 10 ETH at market value. It is impermanent because the supply of tokens in the pool can return to a 1 BTC to 10 ETH ratio in the future. The loss becomes permanent once funds are withdrawn from the pool. But if a liquidity provider gains enough exposure, rewards from transaction fees can potentially make up for the impermanent loss. Is impermanent loss actually difficult to spot? The reason many find it difficult to spot impermanent loss isn’t because it is an inherent mystery – it is a calculable math problem. The team at Amberdata explained that due to its complexity, most resources only provide estimates. Say that you use your LP tokens in a yield farming endeavor that generates rewards on another protocol. Estimates on the exchange can’t account for those rewards. So even if it is showing impermanent loss, it could be that your yield farming endeavor makes back the loss. A full assessment requires multiple data points, but if you have a clear view of what’s needed, that calculation can be precise and provide actionable investing data. Plus, IL is different for everyone because portfolios have a different mix of tokens pairs. People also don’t deposit and withdraw at the same times or prices. To calculate PnL for a liquidity position, you need data on: Each token’s price at deposit The amount of each token deposited Date of deposit Rate of reward for the liquidity pool Estimated price of each token at withdrawal Date of withdrawal LP token yield farming strategies Because there are so many variables in calculating the difference between projected gains from holding tokens versus LP fees, many struggle to make a useful conclusion about whether to enter or exit a liquidity pool. As an added complication, the risk and reward is different for every token pair depending on each one’s volatility. The more diverse the portfolio, the more difficult this becomes. How to calculate impermanent loss There are detailed mathematical explanations for how to calculate IL, but in brief, a formula can be used. IL increases the more an asset’s price changes relative to its pair. This is plotted on a graph. In this very simplified example, you can see that IL happens whether prices go up or down. But the loss is much greater as a token’s price goes down. This causes many liquidity providers to look for token pairs that are likely to appreciate at a similar rate over time. //<![CDATA[\nwindow.__mirage2 = {petok:\"v8WnkAaavU6MSu9.gd0r2BLUxywnW5aHwlIWsUg4FeA-1800-0.0.1.1\"};\n//]]> Can you avoid impermanent loss? Since impermanent loss is triggered by unequal prices changes, the best way to avoid it is by avoiding volatile token pairs. But Amberdata stresses that there are always a wide array of investment choices in a cost-benefit analysis. For example, simply avoiding IL may not make sense when you measure a pool’s IL costs vs transaction fee rewards. The most informed decision evaluates the potential return in relation to other pools and opportunities. This comprehensive approach helps the liquidity provider find alpha. In our conversation, Amberdata said that they offer their clients comprehensive insights across decentralized finance, and can quantify historical performance in context to other liquidity pools and investment strategies. They provide the data needed for a full risk/reward assessment that ultimately informs liquidity providers in their search for alpha. One of the most useful tools for providing liquidity is Amberdata’s impermanent loss endpoint . With it, liquidity providers can get the exact data needed to evaluate IL risk for token pairs in specific liquidity pools on different DEXs. Why comprehensive data is important Amberdata said that their endpoint tools don’t take shortcuts when it comes to calculating impermanent loss. Their application collects liquidity pool data from across exchanges and tracks activity to get accurate, customized calculations. For example, many IL calculations do not account for the mints and burns that a liquidity provider may make in a single day. Minting refers to the LP tokens that are created when funds are deposited. Those tokens are then burned when funds are withdrawn. Liquidity providers will often try to time minting and burning to avoid volatile price swings in a pool. If their IL estimate is only a 24 hour snapshot of what impermanent loss would be from the start to the close of the day, then they will not be able to measure the impact of their liquidity positions. Amberdata takes those intraday mints and burns into consideration when calculating IL. While the precision of an IL calculation is critical, it doesn’t provide the full story. Even if a liquidity provider is able to avoid IL through savvy burning and minting practices, it doesn’t mean that they maximized return. Effective back-testing of liquidity provider strategies requires comprehensive data points that detail the potential transaction fee rewards when an LP is in and out of a position. Amberdata said that they built their services so that liquidity providers could use this comprehensive approach to put their best strategies forward. This post is sponsored by Amberdata .

But this time, his new billion-dollar venture Flow has scored a prominent backer: venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. And the company intends to dabble in cryptocurrencies. Flow, which scored a $350 million investment from a16z, plans to launch a digital wallet that can hold cryptoassets — as well as currencies, including the US dollar — Forbes reported on Wednesday. The company’s real estate management software will also function on the wallet. The plans for the wallet remain unspecified for now. A Flow spokesperson, Davidson Goldin, told Forbes that it won’t be used to make rental payments using crypto for apartments managed by the firm, but can be used for external purchases, like other wallets. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Goldin’s comments suggested that Flow won’t be heavily involved with cryptocurrencies, nor would the firm be a leader in the implementation of blockchain. Still, he added that Flow could use crypto for a tokenized rewards program. Flow doesn’t yet have an established website — it merely displays is an expected launch in 2023 and a general contact option. Flow isn’t linked to Web3 startups The WeWork founder is no stranger to real estate, but that’s not the only sector he’s tried his hand in. After building shared-office spaces around the world, and doing so while burning money rapidly, he was ultimately forced to step down from the company he started. Neumann subsequently founded Flowcarbon, which surfaced earlier this year, aiming to issue cryptocurrencies backed by carbon credits. Andreesen participated in a $70 million round towards the platform in May, as part of its $4.5 billion venture fund . But the crypto market downturn stymied that ambition, with CEO Dana Gibber saying it would “wait for markets to stabilize” to launch a token. On the face of it, Flowcarbon and Flow don’t appear to be affiliated except for sharing a co-founder. Intriguingly, a16z’s blog calls Flow, Neumann’s “first venture since WeWork.” There is also the unrelated blockchain project from Dapper Labs which already uses a token with the ticker FLOW, the price of which briefly spiked due to confusion over the name. Loading Tweet.. So the latest investment is Andreesen’s second bet on Neumann since WeWork. The venture firm is backing Flow because Neumann “revolutionized” commercial real estate through WeWork and “fundamentally redesigned the office experience,” Andreesen said. Lifestyle changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to more people working remotely and will make them “experience much less, if any, of the in-office social bonding and friendships that local workers enjoy,” he said. The blog didn’t detail what specific problems Flow is setting out to solve, but said it’s a “direct strike” on the current housing market crisis.

The Justice Department’s money laundering unit asked the world’s largest crypto exchange nearly two years ago to hand over messages from CEO Changpeng Zhao and other executives on matters including its detection of illegal transactions and US customer recruitment, according to the report. The 2020 letter reportedly made nearly 30 requests for documents that included details of Binance’s policies to combat illegal finance, or reports of suspicious financial activity it had filed to authorities, among other matters.

Crypto exchange execs already stung by Bank Secrecy Act While Binance is reportedly deals with its own Bank Secrecy Act investigation, prominent executives at crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX have already been sentenced for violations. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes and Ben Delo pleaded guilty in February. As part of the plea agreement, the pair was ordered to pay $10 million each for their involvement in “willfully failing” to implement and maintain anti-money laundering measures at BitMEX. Another co-founder, Samuel Reed, pleaded guilty to the same count the following month and also agreed to pay $10 million. Earlier this month, BitMEX’s head of business development Gregory Dwyer pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in a similar manner. He agreed to pay a $150,000 fine and faces up to five years in prison. Hayes was sentenced to six months of house arrest followed by two years of probation; Delo received 30 months probation; and Reed was sentenced to 18 months probation. Regulation by enforcement will continue in the absence of concrete crypto legal frameworks, industry executives and lawyers have told Blockworks. The Reuters report came two days after US Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., sent letters to four federal agencies and five crypto exchanges — including Binance — requesting information on their mechanisms to tackle fraud and scams.

        "text": "key takeaways The license will allow SBI Digital Markets to advise on corporate finance, dealing in capital markets products and provide custodial services MAS’ stance towards firms servicing institutional clients of crypto contrasts its approach to protecting retail investors A crypto-focused subsidiary of Japanese financial services giant SBI Group has received the regulatory nod to offer its securities to institutional clients in Singapore. SBI Digital Markets, which operates under Tokyo-based SBI Digital Asset Holdings, said its capital markets services (CMS) license will allow it to advise on corporate finance, deal in capital markets products and provide custodial services. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), also the region’s central bank, granted the license following in-principle approval given in May, according to a statement on Thursday. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Businesses are required to hold a CMS license to conduct activities regulated under the Securities and Futures Act which, among other areas, includes fund management and product financing. SBI Digital Markets joins a handful of other companies in Singapore offering custodial services to institutional investors tailored for crypto assets. While seemingly more receptive to institutional business within the island-city-state, MAS has stiffened its approach to retail crypto investment following the collapse of Terra in May. Now-defunct crypto hedge fund firm Three Arrows Capital, which had exposure to the algorithmic stablecoin throughout its demise, had been headquartered in Singapore since 2013. Its founders were reportedly planning to relocate primary operations to Dubai earlier this year. In April, MAS closed a loophole that had allowed virtual asset service providers to offer their business abroad while evading oversight at home. “Singapore’s financial regulatory system is among the most respected in the world for its rigor and transparency,” SBI Digital Markets’ CEO Winston Quek said in the statement. MAS chair Tharman Shanmugaratnam in July proposed introducing customer suitability tests while restricting their use of leverage and credit facilities. At the time, digital asset markets were reeling from cascading liquidations which ultimately spurred bankruptcies of crypto lenders Celsius and Voyager. The regulator has often voiced its concerns around the new asset class, pointing to extreme periods of volatility and an increase in shady practices as a means to protect mom-and-pop investors. And while MAS believes those limitations could help alleviate financial harm, Shanmugaratnam conceded late last month that banning retail access to crypto assets wouldn’t work .

        "text": "key takeaways The anticipated $3 billion fundraise comes after the venture capitalist’s firm, Social Capital, has been largely closed to outside investors for about four years Up to 70% of the new vehicle’s capital has been earmarked for its top 10 positions In an unexpected move to once again start accepting outside capital, Chamath Palihapitiya is angling to raise at least $3 billion for his latest, top-heavy venture capital fund, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But this time around, the longtime crypto bull doesn’t plan to give digital assets much play. Palihapitiya’s firm Social Capital has effectively functioned as a quasi-proprietary trading firm for the last several years, having pulled the plug on a number of longtime investors to focus on investing largely founder capital. If Palihapitiya pulls it off, the ambitious multi-billion dollar fundraise would go down as his most ambitious achievement to date and perhaps ease the sting of his latest SPAC woes . Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The vehicle would be Social Capital’s fifth to date. Past funds, to various degrees, have taken substantial crypto exposures, including beginning to buy into bitcoin as a firm in 2013. The venture firm has also backed the likes of NFT marketplace SuperRare and Solana’s Saber Labs . While digital asset-oriented startups — especially emerging play-to-earn gaming and Web3 companies, plus fintech firms trying to bridge crypto and TradFi — ought to remain one area of focus, crypto collectively appears to be overshadowed by other portfolio priorities. Sources were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive business dealings. The firm declined to comment. Axios first reported Social re-opening to external capital. The main priorities for Fund V: backing promising startups looking to solve real-world issues across climate, deep technology (including machine learning and artificial intelligence) and cloud computing. While Palihapitiya and his team have at times played up their crypto track record in conversations with potential institutional limited partners, digital assets appear to be taking a backseat, here. Though TradFi players have been keeping a close eye on crypto’s recent turmoil in the pursuit of vulture-style venture plays and distressed debt opportunities, indications are few asset managers have actually pulled the trigger. That is true, as it is in Social’s case, because of an uncertainty in calling the bottom for spot cryptoassets — which all but uniformly impact valuations in the private sector — and a reluctance of top would-be investors, such as conservative sovereign wealth funds, to put sizable capital to work in the space. In other words, the risk-reward profile is not yet there, in the eyes of some. Fund V kicked off fundraising in recent weeks, with the plan being to launch sometime in the first quarter of 2023, at the earliest — contingent on fundraising. The fund is being marketed as having a 10% general partner commitment, or $300 million, an unusually high allocation in venture capital, where limited partners often gripe that portfolio managers don’t have enough personal skin in the game. The vehicle is designed to split its capital into three main, equally-weighted buckets: $1 billion for early-stage companies receiving checks of between $10 million to $20 million; $1 billion for late stage companies, with checks averaging $100 million to $200 million; $1 billion for massive checks of $250 million to $450 million for opportunistic stakes in companies at various stages of development. Fund V’s top 10 positions are earmarked to account for a whopping 70% of its entire portfolio. The term is for 10-years, plus an optional two-year extension, along with an investment period of five years. Social’s management cut is 2% and plans to take 30% of carried interest.

The state regulator claimed in the filing that FTX US’s yield-bearing account offerings are classified as unregistered securities. Texas authorities compared FTX US’ offering, which gives users up to 8% annual percentage yield on their first $10,000 investment, to now-bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital ’s product. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “FTX US…may be offering unregistered securities in the form of yield-bearing accounts to residents of the United States,” a state filing stated. “These products appear similar to the yield-bearing depository accounts offered by Voyager Digital LTD et al., and the Enforcement Division is now investigating FTX Trading, FTX US, and their principals, including Sam Bankman-Fried.” In the filing, a state regulator claims that yield-earning accounts were offered to a US resident. The regulator claims that US residents are directed to use the FTX Trading app, even though these services are not available in the US. Former FTX US President Brett Harrison confirmed in July 2021 that the exchange’s yield offerings were available to any user that has access to FTX or FTX US.

We look forward to continue working with Texas.” Given that FTX Trading is headquartered in the Bahamas and incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda and is not available in the US, it is unclear how much authority the state regulator may have. State regulators also pointed to the exchange’s current registrations in the filing, noting that FTX.US is not currently registered as a money transmitter with the Texas Department of Banking nor is it registered as a securities dealer with the Texas State Securities Board. “FTX Trading and FTX US may not be fully disclosing all known material facts to clients prior to opening accounts and earning yield, thereby possibly engaging in fraud and/or making offers containing statements that are materially misleading or otherwise likely to deceive the public,” the filing added.

HUSD fell to a low of 28 cents this morning, four days after the crypto exchange announced it would delist the token. Huobi, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the space, was recently snapped up by a Hong Kong-based asset management firm About Capital, which is reportedly spearheaded by Justin Sun. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe While Sun has denied being in charge of About Capital (as he initially did when he acquired Poloniex), the controversial crypto entrepreneur is an official Huobi advisor following the deal. Sun told CoinDesk earlier this month that Huobi would “probably list all the cryptocurrency against USDD,” a Tron-based stablecoin. Huobi recently said all users’ HUSD would be converted to Tether (USDT) at a 1-to-1 ratio. The stablecoin was launched in September 2019, with its market capitalization briefly peaking at $1 billion in May 2021. However, HUSD since failed to capture significant market share, hovering as low as $80 million last month. HUSD no longer features on Huobi but the token continues to trade on decentralized exchanges, with MDEX contributing nearly 90% of the daily trade volume. All this while Huobi may be undergoing a complete overhaul of its teams. China-based journalist Colin Wu reported on Saturday that Sun’s TRON team appears to have taken charge of key divisions at the crypto trading firm, and Huobi’s current strength of 1,600 may be downsized as Sun believes there are too many employees. In a tweet on Monday, Sun said his team was “extremely cautious” about the company’s future staff arrangements. Huobi didn’t return Blockworks’ request for comment by press time. Huobi indeed appears to be in flux, but stablecoins have faced several headwinds over the last few months, including increased regulatory focus and changes in market perception from recent high-profile incidents like the collapse of Terra.

The price of Polygon’s MATIC token has gone up by 6% over the past week. By comparison, it’s competitor, Solana has seen the price of its token SOL dip by 46 % . In addition to stablecoins, traders looking for a safe haven have turned to PAX Gold (PAXG) issued by Paxos, which has seen an 8.2% price increase. Chris Kline, chief revenue officer and co-founder of Bitcoin IRA told Blockworks that MATIC is more hyper-focused and specialized than other cryptocurrencies, which may have allowed it to protect itself during market fluctuations. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “Polygon’s MATIC token is used to pay transaction fees and participate on the network,” Kline said. “Although MATIC, like all other cryptocurrencies, is 60%+ lower than its all-time highs of 2021. MATIC’s price has likely outperformed thanks to the announcement of Polygon’s partnership with Instagram last Thursday, where creators will be able to make their own digital collectables and sell them on the platform.

In fact, yesterday, Polygon revealed that it was working with Disney to develop a proof of concept for exclusive digital collectables. Loading Tweet.. Tapping into the creator economy space may have been the reason that the Polygon token has held up during the cryptocurrency meltdown. “The value added to the creator economy is unmatchable and championing verifiable digital ownership on a platform with such reach will help us further our goal of onboarding the next billion users to Web3,” Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder of Polygon said in a tweet. This sentiment is shared by Harsh Rajat, CEO at Push Protocol who told Blockworks “the reason the price of MATIC has been trending upwards and will likely continue to do so is because the number of wallet addresses continues to do so as well.” Adding that, “the number of unique wallet addresses is the simplest indicator in the health and growth of a network, and it’s clearly thriving on Polygon as more addresses are being added every day despite a downturn in the market.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "url": "https://blockworks.co/news/paxful-dumps-ethereum",
        "text": "Peer-to-peer marketplace Paxful has decided to remove the world’s second-largest crypto from its platform. CEO Ray Youssef, in a t weet on Wednesday, pointed to several reasons for ether’s removal, including the blockchain’s recent switch from a proof-of-work consensus model to proof-of-stake (PoS). “[PoS] has rendered ETH essentially a digital form of fiat,” Youssef tweeted. “Proof-of-work (PoW) is the innovation that makes bitcoin the only honest money there is.” Ethereum flipped its consensus model in September, following years of back-and-forth between its developer community and stakeholders. Youssef has long advocated for bitcoin’s use in payments, e-commerce and wealth preservation, which sits at odds with the crypto’s depreciating value this year. PoS achieves consensus through the staking of crypto behind each newly created block. PoW, meanwhile, requires miners to expend energy on computational power to search for a cryptographic needle in a haystack that gives them the right to produce a block. Ethereum’s move this year was viewed by many in the industry as a positive step toward grappling with its long-standing issue over the network’s energy consumption — a criticism often levied at bitcoin. Since the Merge , Ethereum uses 99.95% less energy than it did under proof-of-work consensus. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Proponents of bitcoin to the exclusion of all other cryptoassets — dubbed maximalists — continuously point to bitcoin’s model as being the most secure based on its proven design to add new blocks to an existing chain. Youssef also pointed to a rise in crypto scams resulting from the easy token creation Ethereum enabled, which he said has “robbed people of billions” and cost the industry’s mission to liberate those held back by an oppressive “evil system” of “economic apartheid.” “Our industry is under attack right now — which means our responsibility to protect our users is greater than ever before,” the CEO said in his tweet. Decentralization also remains a primary issue for Paxful and its head, who said, without providing evidence, that Ethereum is controlled by a select few that would later require permission to use it. Analysis by Macauley Peterson Very little has changed regarding Ethereum’s decentralization metrics as a result of the Merge. Ethereum’s software upgrades or forks require the agreement from operators of its decentralized network of nodes, much like bitcoin. The number of nodes has fluctuated in recent years from a low of about 2,600 to a high of about 12,000, according to data from ethernodes . Available bitcoin nodes in a similar timeframe have been more stable, oscillating between about 8,200 and 10,200, per bitnodes data. (Bitcoin core developer LukeDashJr estimates the number of “updated nodes” — another metric —  is actually higher at around 32,000.) That includes miners which necessarily operate full bitcoin nodes, but also the many node operators around the world who are not miners. The independent decisions of node operators in both cases is the ultimate arbiter of how the networks develop. The open-source software running each network gradually evolves through a consensus building process among a much smaller group of software engineers. According to a September report from NYDIG, which tracked the growth of Bitcoin Core developers over time using data from GitHub, there have been between 30 and 60 monthly active developers over the past three years. //<![CDATA[\nwindow.__mirage2 = {petok:\"fnXKO9dvA7DCx7fg3d2OaqSWqrvfJGbJ5Iyo.y9s0Ew-1800-0.0.1.1\"};\n//]]> Source: NYDIG / GitHub A much smaller group of 13 developers have had the responsibility for cryptographically signing each Bitcoin Core software release since Sep. 2021, which allows users to verify its authenticity. Ethereum currently has 76 contributors listed on its project management repository on GitHub, a subset of which attend its periodic All Core Developer consensus calls.

        "text": "Once high-flying crypto trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg has been confined to a Puerto Rican jail for the foreseeable future — capping off a rapid fall to what by most appearances had been a remarkable rise. US prosecutors have deemed Eisenberg responsible for financial fraud and market manipulation in relation to an October 2022 attack on Mango Markets, a DeFi trading platform built on the Solana blockchain. It resulted in an initial loss of at least $112 million of cryptoassets. Digital asset traders have been keeping a close eye on the case, especially considering Mango’s native token ( MNGO ) has plummeted some 48% since the exploit. It’s now trading around two cents. Still, MNGO bulls have toured the resilience of the token, especially in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse that sent virtually all cryptocurrencies reeling. That, coupled with other macro forces, has likewise applied downward pressure to MNGO, plus other DeFi assets — in addition to Eisenberg’s alleged misconduct. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Here’s a look at how Eisenberg got here via a timeline of consequential events outlining his attempts to reverse his “highly profitable trading strategy” — and how he wound up in the crosshairs of US prosecutors. New court documents dubs Eisenberg flight risk A court document issued Wednesday signed off on by the judge overseeing the case grants prosecutors’ request to keep Eisenberg behind bars, where he’s set to remain under the custody of the US Attorney General. Their rationale: he’s subject to a lengthy incarceration if convicted and has significant family ties outside the US. US Magistrate Bruce J. McGiverin, who issued the order, agreed with prosecutors in saying the reasoning behind Eisenberg’s continued custody is strongly tied to upwards of $40 million of outstanding digital assets. The missing funds, plus his dual citizenship, offers both the means and motivation to flee the country, the order says. Eisenberg ousts himself The fast-developing case against the self-styled “game theorist” largely stems from the Mango manipulation last year. Eisenberg later admits responsibility by orchestrating a complex attack that acted on the spot price of Mango’s token to drive up his own holdings. He then is said to have taken out lines of credit collateralized by that value — before exiting the protocol altogether. Following the Oct. 12 exploit, Eisenberg comes forward a week later claiming to be part of a group that drained Mango’s funds. On Twitter, Eisenberg attempts to justify their actions as “legal,” because they had used the protocol “as designed.” Loading Tweet.. Of the $112 million taken, Eisenberg returns $67 million in various digital assets, which is later voted on as a refund split by Mango’s decentralized autonomous organization. Prosecutors come a-knockin’ Shortly after the holidays, Eisenberg is charged with commodities fraud and market manipulation by US prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and is arrested in Puerto Rico. In a Dec. 19 complaint , prosecutors allege Eisenberg willfully and knowingly attempted to manipulate and defraud markets, enabling him to withdraw millions in multiple cryptocurrencies with no intention of returning them.

        "text": "Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase isn’t shying away from advertising despite cutting costs in other areas. The exchange is strengthening ties with German soccer club Borussia Dortmund (BVB), local outlet Handelsblatt reported . After establishing a partnership in July 2021, the club displayed ads for Coinbase on screens in its stadium and held crypto-related educational workshops for its employees. That partnership is now leveling up as advertising will expand across marketing channels, including ads on the club’s stadium perimeter board, which will enhance virtual exposure for Coinbase at local events. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe A Coinbase spokesperson previously told Blockworks the exchange intends to keep all its current sports sponsorship commitments . For now, the partnership has a time period and will reportedly last until June. The club’s managing director Carsten Cramer indicated that prudence is due to the crypto industry still being relatively new. “That’s why we want to keep our flexibility open,” he told Handelsblatt. Borussia is the name of a local Dortmund brewery. The football club which dates back to 1909 is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, so it has a responsibility to shareholders to be cautious about its partnerships. Coinbase was the first company to gain a license for crypto custody from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in June 2021, which was a significant reason for the club’s decision to partner with the company. Now, some five companies hold the same permit. Neither Coinbase nor BVB have mentioned how much BVB is getting for the sponsorship,  though Cramer said they “didn’t receive the most tempting offer.” The soccer world has become an attractive sector for crypto partnerships. Crypto[dot]com was a prominent brand in last year’s FIFA World Cup held in Qatar. And Coinbase already inked sports partnerships with the National Basketball Association, the Women’s National Basketball Association and other affiliates in 2021. Still, the exchange was impacted by the crypto winter and cut more than 2,000 jobs in the last year. It also recently decided to pull out of a major crypto market, saying it would shut down operations in Japan. Coinbase and BVB expect to decide whether to extend their partnership by April or May.

        "text": "key takeaways key takeaways Fund manager VanEck filed for its bitcoin trust  in December 2020, and the SEC has previously delayed making a decision on the product The SEC is “extremely unlikely” to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, according to CFRA’s head of ETF and mutual fund research The deadline for the SEC to rule on VanEck’s spot bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, with the agency’s 240-day review period expiring on November 14. The New York-based fund group filed for its bitcoin trust , which would invest directly in bitcoin, on December 30 of last year. A dozen or so other similar products sit alongside it in registration. As spot bitcoin ETFs await approval, the SEC allowed ProShares to launch a bitcoin futures ETF on October 19, and a similar fund by Valkyrie came to market three days later. Futures-based bitcoin offerings from VanEck and Global X are also expected to launch. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Though the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has grown to nearly $1.3 billion in assets under management, some industry watchers have said they expect investor demand for a spot bitcoin product to be much higher. A flood of filings for futures-based bitcoin ETFs came in August after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler implied during a virtual forum in August that the agency would favor ETFs filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which are limited to CME-traded bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC last week moved back the deadline to make a decision on the proposed Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund by 60 days — from November 8 to January 7, 2022. Valkyrie Funds CEO Leah Wald told Blockworks in an email that the delay was not surprising and was in line with interactions the firm has had with the SEC. “We believe this a positive step because it means the agency is taking the time to deliberate and wholly consider the merits of such a product coming to the market,” she said at the time. But the SEC, which has previously delayed its decision on VanEck’s proposal, must now approve or deny the product by November 14, industry professionals have explained. Loading Tweet.. The SEC is “extremely unlikely” to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. “The SEC continues to have concerns about fraud related to the cryptocurrency that are unlikely to be alleviated in the near term,” he told Blockworks. “I don’t have a forecast to when that will change.” James Seyffart, an ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday that though he believes the SEC should approve the proposed VanEck offering, he expects the agency to deny it. “But, the denial letter should give us insight into [the] SEC’s current views/opinions on [the] underlying bitcoin market,” he added. BlockFi and Neuberger Berman became the latest issuers looking to launch a bitcoin ETF. Bitwise Asset Management also recently filed to launch the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust, and the fund group published roughly 150 pages of data-driven research with the filing that sought to address SEC concerns. The firm published the research to put it on the record and have the SEC respond to it, said Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan said, adding that the agency’s response to the findings could move the industry forward. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said during a recent Blockworks podcast that he would estimate December 2022 as his “over-under” for a spot bitcoin ETF approval. Wald, who joined Balchunas on the podcast, noted that she believed it would be sooner. Kevin O’Leary, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist known widely outside the financial world for his appearances on ABC’s Shark Tank , told Blockworks in August that he doesn’t think the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF in the US until at least 2023. “I have no more information than anybody else — but I’ve listened to the regulator trying to read the tea leaves,” O’Leary said at the time. “I think they’re going to go slowly into this.” Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

        "title": "Robinhood Sells Your Data, but Does That Matter?",
        "url": "https://blockworks.co/news/robinhood-sells-your-data-but-does-that-matter",
        "text": "Shooters shoot. Traders trade. And Robinhood sells your data. Word on the street says retail can now move the market. The argument goes like this: Retail traders are bored (quarantine) with money on their hands (stimulus) and more powerful and cheaper tools than ever before (Robinhood). A research paper titled A Requiem for the Retail Investor found that “In 1950, retail investors owned over 90% of the stock of U.S. corporations. [As of 2009], retail investors own less than 30% and represent a very small percentage of U.S. trading volume. In a more recent study run by New York University economist Edward Wolff, Wolff found that “More than 93 percent of the stock is owned by the top 20 percent of households. The bottom 80 percent of households own only about 7 percent.” This doesn’t necessarily mean that retail is dead though. Spend one day on FinTwit and you’ll quickly see otherwise. TD Ameritrade disclosed a record 608,000 new funded accounts for Q1, as well as more than 3x the number of users in March 2020 compared to March 2019. Brokerages like Schwab, Fidelity and E*Trade also reported record new users. Without casinos and sports, gamblers are moving into the stock market. With returns of 7,000% in two weeks, equities like GameStop are providing plenty of reason. So retail is alive and well, but back to the original question… does it drive the market? This is where it gets tricky. You see, Robinhood sells the retail order flow to high-frequency traders [HFTs] and big hedge funds like Citadel. These traders could then use HFT algorithms to front run the trades, which would massively accentuate the retail momentum. In reality, it’s much more nuanced than this.  There is an entire business around selling order book data, but it might not actually be a bad thing for consumers. Quick Background on Robinhood Robinhood was founded in April 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who had previously built high-frequency trading platforms for financial institutions in New York City. In December 2013, Robinhood raised a $3M seed round. Now, just seven years after launching, Robinhood has raised $1.2B and has over 10M users. Roughly 80% of Robinhood’s customers are millennials and the average customer age is just 26, according to the Wall Street Journal. Robinhood’s marketing pitch is that you can trade for free. So how does this thriving company actually make money? Payment for Order Flow Claiming that popular companies make money by selling consumers’ data has been all the rage for several years now. Remember this phrase? Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “If You’re Not Paying for the Product, You are the Product.” Well, it turns out that still exists. Twitter users were outraged this past week when they heard that Robinhood makes money by selling users’ trading data to high frequency trading firms. If you’re a Robinhood user, your blood pressure may have gone up a few notches when you realized that more sophisticated investors than yourself are front running your trades. Let’s slow down though and zoom out. Robinhood does indeed make money, in part, by sending customer orders to high-frequency traders in exchange for cash. But so does everyone else! This practice is called “payment for order flow”, or PFOF for short. It’s a common practice among brokerages such as TD Ameritrade, Schwab, and E*Trade. Though Robinhood has faced the most criticism for its PFOF business, which was up 227% in 2018, in reality, nearly every brokerage has been selling their customers’ orders to market makers like Virtu, Two Sigma, and Citadel for years. Based on historical numbers, Robinhood’s PFOF business probably brings in around $150 million to $250 million annually. Why Do Market Makers Want Robinhood’s Data? Market makers make money on the spread between the bid and the ask. They provide liquidity to the market, which means they take the other side of trades. When a sophisticated institutional investor, such as a large hedge fund, come to a market maker, this can be risky for the market maker. If the hedge fund is selling a large volume of securities, there’s probably a good reason for it. If the market maker takes the other side of the trade and buys the securities that the hedge fund is selling, there’s a decent chance that the market will keep moving in the hedge fund’s favor. This exposes the market maker to downside risk. With retail traders though, it’s virtually impossible for this to happen. Retail traders, by virtue of them being retail, don’t trade in large sizes nor do they coordinate with other retail traders. They’re generally less sophisticated than institutional traders so for a market maker, it’s rare that you’ll lose money on making a market for retail traders. Basically, it’s more profitable and risk free to make markets for retail as compared to institutional. In fact, Virtu—one of largest market makers—executed nearly 25 percent of retail shares for S&P 500 securities with orders between 100 and 1,999 shares in January, putting its market share behind only Citadel ( S&P Global ). So, trading firms are taking retail orders from Robinhood. But they’re not doing anything illegal. They’re simply doing what they’re supposed to do: providing liquidity and making markets. In fact, the market making firms like Citadel and Virtu are one of the reasons why Robinhood users can place trades for free. Less than 50% of Robinhood’s Revenue Comes from PFOF According to a Bloomberg report last year, Robinhood brought in around 40 percent of its revenue in 2018 from selling its customers’ orders to market makers. So what makes up the 60 percent? A combination of a subscription service called Robinhood Gold (because when in Silicon Valley, we must have recurring revenues…), net interest from cash deposits, and income from lending stocks purchased on margin. We don’t need to discuss Robinhood Gold much because it’s simple to understand. For $5/month, you get access to “Morningstar research reports, NASDAQ Level II Market Data, bigger instant deposits, and margin investing.” Income from lending stocks purchased on margin probably makes up a decent chunk of Robinhood’s revenue, but it’s really the net interest from cash deposits that brings home the bacon for Robinhood This is a good time to remind you that we don’t have access to any Robinhood data that you don’t have. These are predictions based on public data. Robinhood is notoriously private about their numbers. Net Interest Margin Patrick McKenzie has the best description of the net interest margin business: Suppose I were to give you $100, in return for your promise to give it back when I wanted it and pay me 0.27% annualized interest in the meanwhile. Suppose you invested this in a virtually riskless bond, perhaps a mortgage-backed security with government backing, offering 2.53% annualized interest. You’d earn $2.26 in net interest in a year. Suppose I were to give you $200 billion dollars. Now I’m the American middle class and you’re Charles Schwab. You would earn something like $5.8 billion dollars in net interest income. This would entirely pay for your sideline business in running a brokerage. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, branch offices, call centers, blah blah blah, it all exists to justify the only pricing page that matters, and all the verbiage on the pricing page is about how much you pay the customer. This is an exaggeration, but not much of one. 57% of Schwab’s revenues are from net interest. The firm could literally give away every other service; discount the mutual fund fees to zero, do away with commissions, etc etc, and they would still be profitable. Schwab isn’t even the leader among discount brokerages in dependence on net interest. That would be E*TRADE, at about 67% of revenues. Interactive Brokers makes 49% and TD Ameritrade 51% in the segment. Did you get that? No? Okay, let’s let Patrick carry on. Some people get mad about the financial industry for taking advantage of customers. I find it hard to get mad about a deal between willing counterparties, but if you think that Wall Street is soaking the US middle class, you should be monomanically focused on the interest spread between cash balances in brokerage accounts and high-interest bank accounts or money market funds. That is the cost that does not call itself a cost. Brokerage customers keep ~10% of their assets in cash. The 200 basis point spread between cash in brokerage accounts and money market funds or insured bank accounts, all of which are functionally riskless, is equivalent to a 20 bps asset management fee across the portfolio. Vanguard’s flagship funds charge about 10 bps for wrapping the entire stock market, SPY (an ETF, which structurally has lower costs) does it for 4 bps, and people think the roboadvisors might be expensive doing similar for 25 bps on top of the underlying investments… and the discount brokerages charge effectively 20 bps over all your assets just for managing the tiny portion that is in cash, the easiest asset to manage. But instead people get mad about payment for order flow, because nobody writes books about Interest Rate Spreads Are Just Too Darn High. To summarize, brokerages like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E*Trade make 50-70% of their revenue from their net interest margin. This is the spread between what the brokerage pays their customers on their cash versus what the brokerage can earn on its investments in 2-year U.S. Treasuries. Net interest margin is how Robinhood makes money. Conclusion The media loves to spin the story that the fictional character Robinhood stole from the rich and gave to the poor and that the fintech app Robinhood sells data from the poor so the rich get richer. Today, it’s never looked more like that is actually the case. At its core, Robinhood is just a computer program that moves money around. It puts a sleek user interface over an API to the financial markets, allowing retail investors to buy $100 worth of Apple. But as soon as Robinhood caved to Citadel and prohibited their users from selling stocks like GameStop or AMC, they became a part of the problem.  You could even argue that they violated their fiduciary duty."
