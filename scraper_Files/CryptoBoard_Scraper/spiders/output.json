The number of daily unique active wallets of game decentralized apps (dapps) and those of game transactions have been at all-time highs since April, according to digital assets data provider DappRadar. And venture capitalists have taken note of — and written checks for — the strong and engaged metaverse game player base, even as activity has trailed off in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs this year. When it comes to gaming investment, DappRadar and the Blockchain Game Alliance recently reported $2.5 billion poured into blockchain games in the first quarter of 2022 alone. In 2021, venture capitalists invested a total of $4 billion in blockchain games. The firms predict investments throughout the rest of the year will increase about 150% from 2021. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Case in point: Gaming investment giant Animoca Brands recorded earnings that value its portfolio at $1.5 billion across over 340 investments. The company also reported income from token and NFT (non-fungible token) sales, contributing to $573 million in net gains over the first quarter. Subsidiaries, such as The Sandbox metaverse and partnerships with Yuga Labs and ApeCoin DAO, are just some of the company’s most profitable ventures, especially when it comes to virtual land sales. Animoca invested $450 million in Bored Ape Yacht Club’s Otherside metaverse game, and the group’s Otherdeed NFT land sale set the record for the largest NFT mint ever conducted. In a message to shareholders, Animoca co-founder and executive chair Yat Siu wrote that “current market conditions will not kill Web3, the open metaverse, NFTs or cryptocurrencies.” In his “sanguine view,” he described the leaders of the shift to Web3 as the companies and projects that are building the open metaverse and encouraged readers to “keep their eyes on the strong growth of the Web3 market.” Venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz, meanwhile, recently launched the $600 million Games Fund One, dedicated to investing in game studios and transforming the Web3 gaming ecosystem. A16z also raised the largest-ever crypto venture fund at $4.5 billion, which brought the firm’s total crypto and Web3 holdings to $7.6 billion. While the traditional gaming industry is currently worth $300 billion, the crypto gaming space is on track to bring the economic potential of the metaverse market to at least $8 trillion .

        "text": "key takeaways BTC Markets’ sister company, BTCM Payments, has been awarded a financial services license from the securities regulator It marks the first time such a license has been handed to a crypto company in Australia Major Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets said Monday it has become the first of its kind in the country to receive a financial services license via its sister company. The Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL), issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), has been awarded to BTCM Payments, according to a statement. The license paves the way for BTC Markets to provide non-cash payment products and general financial advice. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe As part of the conditions surrounding licensure, BTC Markets has been appointed as an authorized representative. For BTCM Payments , which was registered on August 5, 2020, it marks an almost two-year journey to be granted an AFSL via ASIC, where it was said to be “engaging in robust and productive discussions.” BTC Markets said the move will allow it to more closely bridge the crypto and traditional finance gap while offering new products to its customers. In Australia, those businesses offering financial services, advice and products must register for a license via ASIC. Crypto remains excluded from the list of those companies required to apply for a license due to lagging regulations around digital assets within the country, though that is expected to change sometime next year. “Our preference has always been to own our own AFSL rather than buying an existing one from a license holder,” BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler said. “We’re now the masters of our own destiny — we have a clean slate and full control over the AFSL.” Bowler also said the license would prepare the exchange business for impending regulation and would bolster BTC Markets’ existing ISO certification while complementing its progress in obtaining a voluntary compliance standard for service organizations (SOC 2). It’s the latest win for the seasoned crypto marketplace which began operating nearly a decade ago. Earlier this year, the exchange inked a deal with stockbroker SelfWealth , establishing it as the first traditional brokerage firm in the country to offer crypto to its clients. “From an industry perspective, we’re seeking to demonstrate how crypto can sit alongside traditional finance to seamlessly work together in a financially inclusive future,” Bowler said.

        "text": "key takeaways Bitcoin and ether were some of the worst performing top-50 cryptocurrencies this month Stablecoin dominance is way up, with the top four dollar-pegged tokens now making up more than 15% of the digital asset market Bitcoin dropped below $19,000 this morning, having shed up to 6% over the past day as benchmark indexes NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 remain muted. Bitcoin (BTC) is trending toward prices last seen two weeks ago when it collapsed to $17,600, its lowest since December 2020 when the bellwether digital asset was on its way toward smashing its 2018 record high. Grimmer still, bitcoin has been one of the worst performing top-50 tokens this month, according to price data compiled by Blockworks. Today’s drop also directly follows MicroStrategy’s additional $10 million bitcoin purchase , suggesting CEO Michael Saylor bought the dip too early. Bitcoin’s price is down about 40% since June 1, landing it in the bottom third of the top 50. Second-largest cryptocurrency ether was the fourth-worst performing, dropping 47% from $1,940 to $1,030 as of 12:30 pm ET. For scale, the worst performing of the top 50 cryptocurrencies — decentralized finance token AAVE and BTC fork bitcoin cash — lost 51% of their value this month. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 fell 8% in June alongside the broader S&P 500, plagued by macroeconomic factors such as inflation and persistent global supply chain headaches. Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the digital asset market is BTC, dropped more than seven percentage points in June, to 43.5%. Ether dominance broke down more than twice as much, now floating around 15%. Collectively, crypto markets tanked 35% over the month, representing $453 billion in representative value lost. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Indeed, investors once again fled volatile assets to dollar-pegged stablecoins, with Binance USD, tether, DAI and USD Coin dominance surging between 42.5 and 64.5 percentage points. Together, those four stablecoins make up more than 15% of all cryptocurrency value right now, practically matching ether, up from 10% at the start of the month. Bitfinex’s LEO token proves most resilient — again As for June’s winners, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex’s native token unus sud leo (LEO) continues to significantly outperform the overall crypto market. It is the only top-50 cryptoasset to have gained value in June, having risen almost 12%. On average, leading cryptocurrencies (sans stablecoins and asset-backed tokens) shed 32%. Blockworks reported almost the exact same result in the month following the disintegration of the Terra ecosystem; LEO was the only top-100 cryptocurrency in the green, although only by half a percent. LEO is by far an outlier, even among its cohort. Rival exchange tokens issued by FTX (FTT), Huobi (HT), Binance (BNB) and KuCoin (KCS) are steeply in the red, respectively down 18%, 33%, 34% and 46%. Bitfinex first issued LEO in 2019 in a private sale as a way to plug losses worth $850 million as a result of Polish raids on its then-payment processor Crypto Capital Corp. Those who bought LEO can recoup their investments by selling the token on public markets as its price appreciates, so the idea goes. Similarly to other exchanges with native tokens, Bitfinex buys and burns LEO supply when trades occur on the platform. Just under 7% of LEO’s supply has been burned to date. June’s price rise added almost $600 million to LEO’s market capitalization to make it the 15th largest token overall, ahead of prominent layer-1 tokens avalanche and matic, but still well behind Binance’s BNB. A Bitfinex spokesperson previously told Blockworks: “LEO’s performance should be viewed as a metric of customer confidence and trust in the platform.” They added correlation could be emerging between LEO’s price and the potential recovery of bitcoin stolen from the exchange in 2016. In February, US authorities seized $3.5 billion in BTC once belonging to Bitfinex and arrested alleged launderers, amateur YouTube rapper Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan and her partner, Ilya Lichtenstein. Bitfinex, a subsidiary of Tether parent iFinex, has pledged to spend at least 80% of those funds on buying and burning LEO – if the crypto indeed ends up back in the hands of the company. Wrong-footed CoinFLEX aims to follow LEO’s path Katie Talati, director of research at digital asset management firm Arca, agreed that authorities’ recovering bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex has been the main driver for LEO’s price appreciation this year, but noted there have been no new developments to the story since February. “In addition, LEO is far more illiquid than other centralized exchange tokens which means it is subject to different price moves and might be why the price is more stable than others in the sector,” Talati told Blockworks in an email. The resounding success of LEO — especially over the year to date — might bode well for smaller crypto exchange CoinFLEX. The firm is planning to issue a recovery token to replace $47 million worth of assets lost after an alleged loan deal with early crypto proponent Roger Ver went awry. Token purchasers would help keep CoinFLEX solvent and are being offered a 20% annualized yield in return. Arca’s Talati, however, isn’t totally sold on the idea: “I wonder who will buy the new issue since Coinflex’s customer base is much smaller, mostly market makers, almost no retail.” It’s also unclear if investors will get their principal back as that is “based on CoinFLEX retrieving funds from their counterparty,” she added. Talati said the principal on the bad loan can be paid back in USDC or CoinFLEX’s native token FLEX, which presents risk for the investor as the token has very little liquidity. “However, people are yield hungry and 20% is very competitive, so [we will] have to watch the sale to see what happens,” Talati said.

        "text": "key takeaways The startup operates as a platform designed to allow for the more seamless startup and integration of DAOs The company already has a number of early business lines live A turn-key DAO platform, DAOLens, turned out one of the more dense funding rounds of late. The startup recently raised $5 million in a pre-seed round led by Nexus Venture Partners. Crypto-focused investment firms Better Ventures and iSeed II also co-led the round. The platform’s ensuing valuation was not disclosed. Though the capital in hand isn’t notably large, the company had 46 backers participate — one of the largest such collections this year. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe DAOLens is aiming to capitalize on a resurgent market for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) — a sector of digital assets and emerging Web3 technologies where interest has remained steady, despite a broad-based market downturn triggered by the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin UST and the woes of crypto lenders including Celsius and Voyager . The segment has been growing, and relatively quickly at that. Indeed, DAOLens executives told Blockworks the startup counts more than 5,000 such collectives worldwide, altogether overseeing more than $9 billion of assets under management. As DAOs grow in usage, an open question is what, exactly, constitutes one. Many of the decentralized organizations feature their own governance token — some based on an in-house blockchain, others that act as a layer-2 on an existing protocol — which allows users to vote on the direction and day-to-day oversight of the group. And, likewise, despite the market downturn, Pratik Poddar, a partner at Nexus, told Blockworks deploying venture dollars in a down market can come with a silver lining: snapping up stakes in companies at bargain-basement prices — especially those working on promising, potentially explosive technologies such as DAOs, he said. Many companies, from crypto native shops to tech firms to traditional finance operators, are all curious about DAOs and wondering how to incorporate them into their business models, he said. But getting them up and running — especially without a working knowledge of tokenomics — can be difficult. That’s ideally where DAOLens steps in. “The idea of what a DAO is, how it functions and what it does — that all might well change,” Poddar said. “But the idea of decentralized work, different organizations and companies and employees and partners having ownership of the work they’re doing — and being able to have one person working in multiple DAOs, that will certainly remain.” More details of what the Bangalore, India-based, startup is doing with the fresh funding, meanwhile, are emerging. It’s running a portal for would-be DAO participants to find collectives that match their interests, as well as an onboarding solution for participants and tools for governing community management functions. Additional participants, among dozens of others, in the pre-seed round include Balaji Srinivasan, formerly of Coinbase and a16z; Kumar Aakash of Matrix Partners; Raj Gokal of Solana; Dean Carlson of SIG; Simon Doherty of Animoca Brands; and executives from firms including Coinbase and SoftBank. The startup was founded in January by Vikram Aditya & Apoorv Nandan. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

Polytrade’s latest counterparty, Teller protocol, ought to permit Polytrade to tokenize real-world invoices and bring those assets on-chain. In traditional finance, invoice financing helps businesses borrow money from insurers via collateral owed by borrowers. Now, on Polytrade, invoices will be assigned to the platform at the loan maturation date and then tokenized. “By utilizing Teller protocol, Polytrade [can] unlock an entirely new liquidity pool, offering a wider array of qualified lenders the chance to provide trade finance credit,” Piyush Gupta, founder of Polytrade, said in a statement. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Ryan Berkun, CEO of Teller, told Blockworks he wanted to build Teller because he felt that for DeFi (decentralized finance) to grow up and increase market share, “we needed to expand to some type of lending based financing or under-collateralized lending.” Knowing that borrowers were on the hunt for access to more capital to grow operations, Berkun said he  “wanted to create an infrastructure that would make it easy for businesses to launch their own lending book.” “That is what Teller is today — a lending marketplace that enables fintech business owners [and] developers with easy infrastructure to source capital from DeFi,” he said. Unlike many other DeFi lending protocols, Teller does not have an internally operated liquidity pool. “Every borrower is different,” Berkun said. “They need different interest rates and different terms.” Teller, as such, has a number of design parallels to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea — with loans standing in for digital collectibles. The protocol lets borrowers to bridge off-chain data to on-chain loan transactions. Businesses and individuals requesting assets will propose a loan request on the platform, and suppliers will commit to assets and loan requests of their choice. The last step to seal the deal is agreeing to terms. Berkun said Teller’s new partnership with Polytrade will help solve international financing trade problems. “Polytrade is bringing legitimate invoicing from trade financing to the on-chain world, so they can source capital for these invoices,” he said. “They’ve been doing this since 2014 in the traditional finance world and have insurance built in on all of these invoices.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

In a tweet thread , Zhao said the November 2019 deal “was never completed” and Binance only provides “wallet services for WazirX as a tech solution.” “Binance has never — at any point — owned any shares of Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX,” Zhao wrote. “WazirX is responsible [for] all other aspects of the WazirX exchange, including user sign-up, [know-your-customer solutions], trading and initiating withdrawals.” That’s despite the deal, at the time, having been made public by both Binance and WazirX, which purported to allow users to buy and sell crypto with Indian rupees (INR) via the Binance Fiat Gateway. WazirX’s co-founder Nischal Shetty has disputed Zhao’s claims, in what’s now a tit-for-tat online feud between the exchange execs. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “WazirX was acquired by Binance,” Shetty tweeted , less than two hours after Zhao had publicly distanced Binance from the exchange. “Binance operates crypto to crypto pairs, processes crypto withdrawal[s].” Binance and WazirX ties examined by Indian regulators WazirX has drawn the ire of the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), the country’s financial watchdog, over allegations Zanmai Labs facilitated money laundering on the exchange. The exchange touts itself as the country’s “largest” crypto exchange with 31.7 million users, about eight million behind another major Indian exchange, CoinDCX’s, which recorded 40 million overall in March. Binance, the country’s fourth-largest exchange, garners roughly 27.6 million users, according to Business Insider India . A recent ED investigation has claimed large amounts of funds were diverted from questionable, non-bank financial institutions and their fintech partners to WazirX, which were then laundered abroad. Domestic Indian publication Business Standard first reported on the investigation. Regulators have accused Zanmai Labs of creating a “web of agreements” with social media management tool Crowdfire, also founded by Shetty, alongside Singapore holding company Zettai and Binance’s Cayman Islands entity. This was meant to obscure ownership of WarzirX, according to a statement Friday. Loading Tweet.. The ED has issued a freeze on Zanmai director Sameer Mhatre’s bank balances worth INR 646,700,000 ($8.1 million) over an alleged failure to cooperate with the agency. Shetty previously claimed WazirX controls all crypto-crypto and INR-based crypto transactions with only intellectual property and preferential agreement with Binance. Zanmai Labs now claims it is only involved in INR-based crypto transactions where all other trades are handled by Binance on WarzirX, the agency said in its statement. WazirX is accused of giving “contradictory and ambiguous” answers to “evade” regulatory oversight from Indian authorities. “Recent allegations about the operation of WazirX and how the platform is managed by Zanmai Labs are of deep concern to Binance,” Zhao said. “Binance collaborates with law enforcement agencies all around the world. We would be happy to work with ED in any way possible.” WazirX and a spokesperson for Zhao did not immediately return a request for comment.

        "text": "key takeaways The judge pointed to concerns the mining business won’t be immediately profitable Lender has received multiple bids to help fund its restructuring Cryptocurrency lender Celsius’ mining business has been a contentious issue during its bankruptcy proceedings, but the firm has received approval to mine and sell bitcoin to support operations. During the second-day hearing on Tuesday, US bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn expressed concern that the mining business wouldn’t be profitable right away, as the company first needs to make investments that help it run at optimal capacity. But he acknowledged that all said and done, it was the company’s business decision — which bankruptcy courts are loath to reject. “At bottom, this is a business judgment decision. It may be very wrong, but we will see,” Glenn said. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Celsius has reportedly tamed opposition from its creditors’ committee by amending its proposal to specify that the proceeds from bitcoin sales would be set apart from the company’s cash for operations. The Department of Justice is still objecting to the plan, however. Before Judge Glenn’s approval, trial attorney Shara Cornell of the DOJ argued the operation wasn’t clear enough to be granted approval. “What we’re really concerned with in this case is transparency and we don’t have that type of visibility into the mining operations,” she said. “For example, we have no understanding at this point in time what the debtors’ utility-related costs are for running these mining rigs.” Separately, at the hearing, Celsius said it received multiple cash injection offers to fund its restructuring process. The firm is scheduled to return to court on Sept. 1 for approval on an auction process. Bigger balance sheet hole, rapid cash burn Earlier in the case, Celsius said it expects the mining business to be key to its restructuring efforts, after which it got permission to spend $5.2 million on construction and imports related to the business. Celsius owns 80,850 bitcoin mining rigs, but only half of those are in operation. As of July 13, the company was mining an average of 14.2 bitcoin (~$341,634) per day, a filing showed. It expects to generate 10,118 bitcoin this year, and 15,000 bitcoin next year. Mining is generally affected by bitcoin’s volatility and isn’t always profitable. Before filing for bankruptcy, Celsius had plans to expand its mining rigs to 120,000 this year. It has previously used bitcoin mining sales to fund business operations and meet an intercompany loan with the parent firm. As the case proceeds, Celsius’ financial woes are becoming more worrying. After initially disclosing a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet, the firm has now said its deficit is actually more than double — at $2.8 billion . A court document filed Aug. 14 shows it expects to burn cash significantly over the next three months, which would leave it with a negative cash flow of nearly $34 million for this quarter. Prior to the second-day hearing, Texas regulators and the lender’s official creditors committee raised issues about how Celsius planned to monetize the business. “The relief that Celsius has asked for is so broad that they could monetize the coins and use the proceeds in any number of ways,” Dan Besikof, partner at law firm Loeb & Loeb, told Blockworks. But Celsius attorney Ross Kwasteniet said, “whether people agree with it or don’t agree with it, it was our business judgement.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz told Blockworks he expects the public listing — via a pending combination with special purpose acquisition company GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. — could occur in the first quarter of next year. Founded in 2016, the Atlanta-based company offers a way to convert cash into bitcoin, ether and litecoin via its roughly 7,000 ATMs in the US and Canada. Bitcoin Depot’s transaction volumes have not historically been correlated to the price of crypto or seen significant impacts based on bull or bear market cycles, the executive added. It eclipsed an all-time high $160 million of transaction volumes during the second quarter of 2022, company data shows, despite the price of bitcoin plummeting to around $20,000. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The company has generated $623 million of revenue and $6 million of net income in the previous 12 months, as of June 30. “Even if the [bitcoin] price drops 10% tomorrow, we don’t expect to see a lot of change,” Mintz said. “We have grown consistently over time, so we think with that growth and the ability to elevate our profile, attract talent and acquire companies, it’s the perfect time to go public,” he added. The crypto ATM landscape There are 38,667 crypto ATMs in the world, according to Coin ATM Radar . Bitcoin Depot is the largest crypto ATM operator — accounting for roughly 18% of all crypto ATMs — followed by CoinCloud and CoinFlip, which have about 5,000 and 4,000 ATMs, respectively. The top 10 operators run about 70% of the world’s crypto ATMs, though there are 257 operators in the US and 59 in Canada, Coin ATM Radar data indicates. The company plans to acquire some of the smaller players in North America, Mintz said. “We think a lot of them would be interested in taking advantage of our economies of scale, our retail relationships, our hardware relationships and our strong management team to take them to the next level with us,” the CEO said. The company launched BDCheckout in June, allowing customers to load cash into their Bitcoin Depot digital wallet at more than 8,000 retail locations, where they can then purchase bitcoin. The news followed its partnership last year with gas station and convenience store chain Circle K. Growth opportunities After the US and Canada, which have 34,223 and 2,573 crypto ATMs, respectively, Spain’s 255 machines is third-highest. Brandon Mintz The drop-off represents a large opportunity to expand Bitcoin Depot’s footprint to other countries, Mintz said. The company is doing market research and has not yet committed to any specific regions. In North America, Bitcoin Depot currently operates ATMs in 47 states and nine Canadian provinces. It is working with New York’s Department of Financial Services to get its BitLicense — the requirement for it to operate in the state. Mintz said he hopes to receive the New York license in the next few months in order to expand to a state that is ripe for growth. New York has about 200 crypto ATMs, while Florida, which has a similar population, has more than 3,000. Mintz said the recent bankruptcies of Voyager Digital and Celsius could spur investors to transact with crypto through Bitcoin Depot. He also pointed to Coinbase revealing in a May regulatory filing that if the company ever declared bankruptcy, its customers could be treated as “general unsecured creditors.” “I think there’s more and more focus on the phrase, ‘not your keys, not your coins,’” Mintz said. “So people are going to be looking more and more for unhosted, non-custodial wallets where they are not subject to any risk by a third party.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "text": "key takeaways Ethereum first showed an intention to switch to proof-of-stake soon after its inception in 2015 Co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s book on proof-of-stake compiled over the last 10 years is due later this month Ethereum has finally switched its underlying consensus model to proof-of-stake (PoS), following the culmination of seven years of planning by the blockchain’s core developers. The protocol’s Merge triggered at 6:43 am UTC (2:43 am ET) on Thursday, Sept. 15, as the blockchain reached a Total Terminal Difficulty of 58,750,000,000T. Ether traded around $1,588.12 after the energy-saving software upgrade, Blockworks Research data showed. After 13 tense minutes, Ethereum developers and researchers confirmed that new blocks, or slots as they’re called on proof-of-stake Ethereum, were being produced and finalized. Loading Tweet.. Over 40,000 live viewers tuned into the Ethereum Foundation’s livestream at the time of the event. “As far as I’m aware, as far as I can tell from this stream everything was absolutely optimal, so that’s just great!” said the host of the celebration event, known as Superphiz from the Eth Stakers community group. Perhaps the most anticipated event in the crypto world, the Merge has been one of the most difficult engineering feats undertaken by the industry, according to analytics firm BitOoda. “It represents switching the underlying consensus engine of the blockchain while Ethereum continues to run and support the $100 billion+ DeFi, NFT and app economy without a hiccup,” Vivek Raman, BitOoda’s head of PoS said. Its upgrade also aims to inadvertently silence critics of the industry’s energy consumption, which has received some of the blame for contributing to climate change. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the merge to PoS dramatically reduces the blockchain’s power consumption by 99.95%. “So many people think that all blockchain projects are terrible for our climate by design,”  Lia Holland, campaigns and communications director at non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future said in a statement . “The Ethereum Merge shows real action from one of the largest chains to reduce its energy usage to 1/1000th of its former consumption.” Enabling PoS will also drop new supply issuance of ETH by 90% , and some proponents claim the impact is equal to three Bitcoin halving events. This means that the number of ether mined per day will reduce from 13,000 to about 1,600 per day. Previously, a single transaction on Ethereum required enough energy to power an average US household for an entire week . Post-merge, that inches closer to just boiling a kettle, according to Juunu Salovaara, head of platform development at carbon credits crypto firm Likvidi. “In terms of energy consumption, it will now sit alongside other protocols that are considered sustainable, such as Tezos, Solana and Algorand,” he said. “Given it’s still the second biggest blockchain in the world by a big margin, it presents an opportunity for sustainable blockchain projects looking for a home.” Wen scalability? And the biggest misconception about the Merge is that it will lower gas fees. “This is not true,” said Steven Walbroehl, Co-Founder & CTO of Halborn. “It is a change of consensus mechanism, not an expansion of network capacity, that would result in lower gas fees.” Alex Connolly, chief technology officer of NFT marketplace and Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Immutable X agrees. “Currently, the primary scalability bottleneck on Ethereum’s total transaction processing is the cost of data availability for rollups,” Connolly said in a blog post Monday. “The near-term (2023) scalability updates are mostly mechanisms to reduce this cost.” Those include a proposal to reduce the cost of data through the storage of data blobs — a data type that holds binary data  — on beacon nodes for a short period of time. The other would be to reduce the cost of data by allowing nodes to store only a subset of data via sharding, Connolly said. Sharding for Ethereum refers to the process of spreading the network’s load and breaking up the data across 64 separate shards. But a definitive time on when that may actually come about is anyone’s guess given Ethereum’s slow and steady approach to development. A long time coming Ethereum first marked its intention to switch to PoS soon after its inception in 2015. The transition has been marked by constant delays which, at the time, were touted as affording the team more time to prepare, much to the chagrin of the network’s impatient userbase. It also gave Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin enough time to compile various writings through his learnings in those years. Those will be published in a book later this month. The Beacon Chain, the core mechanism of the new network, finally launched in December 2020. That was one of the first milestones leading up to the event. Since then, Ethereum has been running both a PoS chain (Beacon Chain) and a proof-of-work (PoW) change. Goerli — Ethereum’s third and final testnet — was one of the last hurdles for the chain to jump through before its final transition to PoS, doing so at the start of last month. The completion of the Merge not only signifies the integration of both chains, but is a major symbolic win for those that have contributed to its codebase over the years. Because the Beacon Chain has been running for almost two years — there have been mainnet shadow forks and 3 live testnet merges — the duration and frequency of the testing greatly increased the likelihood of success, Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ Digital Assets, told Blockworks. What are the risks? Some major risks to the Merge included any unforeseen technical problems or a material change in gas fees. And while those that have played an important part in the network’s stability as a PoW concept, some are less accepting of the change. The Controversial Ethereum PoW fork (ETHW), expected to formally launch within 24 hours of the Merge, is one such concept challenging the transition to PoS which threatens to put miners out of business. Still, most of the industry intends to move ahead with minor issues able to be easily remedied by developers post-Merge, analysts say. “The Ethereum foundation’s $1 million reward for programmers that found bugs is one example of the amount of focus and energy on nailing this effort,” Connors said. A great deal has now fundamentally changed for ETH token holders and the Ethereum network. Debate around whether Ethereum could flippen Bitcoin will continue in the months after the Merge.

        "text": "key takeaways New Zealand, with a population of 5 million, is considered a fintech pioneer by the exchange and its move there makes sense, Binance said Its expansion to the country follows its successful registration as a financial service provider with the country’s business ministry Binance has expanded its operations to New Zealand following a successful registration with the country’s business ministry earlier this month. Binance New Zealand will join existing entities operating under the company’s name, including in Australia, Italy and more recently France. General manager Ben Rose, formerly of local software development firm CodeHQ will lead operations within the island nation. The exchange and crypto infrastructure provider said the move to become a registered financial service provider with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment made sense despite the country’s lower population and small domestic markets. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “A lot of major tech firms are slow to open a New Zealand office,” Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a statement. “I guess for some, it’s easy to overlook … but we see significant value in having a serious New Zealand presence.” The island nation, situated east of Australia within the South Pacific Ocean, has a population of roughly 5.1 million, according to the latest national estimates . Of that, roughly 268,000 Kiwis own crypto, with a 69% and 31% split between men and women, a Finder survey shows. A measured approach Binance is looking to do things by the book after suffering multiple regulatory setbacks last year across varying jurisdictions. Britain’s financial watchdog barred Binance’s UK arm from conducting any regulated activity in July 2021 while regulators across Europe also moved heavily against the exchange’s derivatives operations, forcing it to wind down that section of its business across the region. Germany, Hong Kong, Italy and Malaysia simultaneously ratcheted pressure last year over concerns Binance had not registered with appropriate authorities or otherwise, at the time, possessed weak anti-money laundering procedures. It was revealed in a late 2020 request by the Justice Department’s money laundering section that it had asked Binance and its executives to hand over messages relating to the exchange’s detection of illegal transactions and recruitment of US customers, Reuters reported earlier this month. Still, following the success of its early days, its infusion of cash and growth from trading activity has all but helped it expand to become one of the largest crypto companies in the world. The measured entrance into New Zealand, as elsewhere, marks a somewhat different approach for the exchange hoping to move forward beyond doubts over its regulatory compliance. And for locals on the ground, the move could translate into cheaper fees denominated in local currency. “This is an exciting development for Kiwi investors and those with an interest in the future of Web3,” Rose said in the statement. “Kiwis can expect to have access to many exciting global product and service innovations happening in this space.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Prior to Kraken and Gemini, Blair Halliday held senior compliance roles at Circle, CashFlow, ICE and Paysafe Group. He also spent 14 years at NatWest Group and spent a year at JPMorgan. “Households are actively thinking about the cost of living and personal finances, and we’re proud to highlight a viable alternative to the current legacy financial system,” Halliday said in a statement. Similarly, as institutions further enter the marketplace they’re in search of crypto firms that complement the highest level of security with outstanding products and services.” Kraken intends to continue hiring in the country and looks to expand its UK product suite with an NFT marketplace and additional spot trading pairs against the British pound sterling (GBP). BlockFi co-founder Flori Marquez is now the company’s chief operating officer, the crypto exchange revealed late last week. In addition to Marquez taking on a new role, Amit Cheela is now BlockFi’s new chief financial officer. Formerly working for ESL Investments, Coastal Investment Management and PwC, he replaces Tony Lauro, who will join BlockFi’s board of directors. Rob Loban , who joined BlockFi in 2020, was promoted to chief accounting officer, while Meg Crowell , who came to BlockFi in 2019, is now its chief people officer. Crowell replaces Laura Cooper, who is now an adviser for the firm. A BlockFi spokesperson declined to comment about the moves. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The executive reshuffle comes a few months after the company signed agreements with FTX US for a $400 million revolving line of credit, as well as for the crypto exchange to buy BlockFi for up to $240 million based on performance triggers. Brian Roberts , who was NFT marketplace OpenSea ’s chief financial officer for nearly a year, has left the role. “I had the rare opportunity to build a team literally from the ground up and handpicked game changers,” he said in a LinkedIn post . “I’ve been working closely with [CEO] Devin Finzer and the supremely capable Justin Jow to ensure a smooth transition, and I will be staying on as an advisor to the company.” Jow joined OpenSea as vice president of finance earlier this year after a three-year stint at Uber. It is unclear whether he will formally take over the CFO role. A spokesperson for OpenSea declined to comment. New CEOs The dYdX Foundation named Charles d’Haussy its new CEO to help grow the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol via partnerships with development teams and other stakeholders. “The technology, teams, and community are remarkable and share the same mission that has motivated me for decades: democratizing access to financial opportunities,” d’Haussy said in a statement. The appointment follows dYdX revealing in January that it would launch a new version of the protocol — the mainnet launch of which is scheduled for the second quarter of 2023. The executive joins the nonprofit from ConsenSys, where he led the company’s growth efforts and global business development in the Asia-Pacific region. Before that, he worked as head of fintech for the Hong Kong government. Web3-focused research and development company Edge & Node appointed co-founder Brandon Ramirez as interim CEO. Despite the interim title, a spokesperson told Blockworks that the company is not searching for a new chief executive. Working as Edge & Node’s head of research and product for the last two years, Ramirez replaces former CEO and co-founder Yaniv Tal, who will continue serving on the company’s board of directors. Edge & Node was created by the core protocol team behind The Graph, an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Ramirez co-founded The Graph and was the lead architect of its initial protocol. “When we started working on The Graph in 2017, developers had to make the difficult choice between building an application that was truly decentralized or one that offered a great user experience,” Ramirez said in a statement. “I’m proud of the role The Graph has played in web3 and…I’m excited to build on that momentum, giving developers and entrepreneurs a powerful decentralized data layer, with open APIs, upon which they can change the world.” In case you missed it NYDIG has laid off about a third of its staff — amounting to roughly 110 people, the Wall Street Journal reported . The reported cuts come after the company completed a $1 billion funding round at a roughly  $7 billion valuation last December, and more recently, raised $720 million for its institutional bitcoin fund . An NYDIG spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. While some crypto companies continue to cut staff, Anchorage Digital is increasing headcount. The crypto platform hired CJ Jouhal as its head of engineering as the company continues its hiring spree despite the crypto market. Jouhal, a former chief technology officer at tech company Clear, told Blockworks that he is focused on continuing to scale Anchorage’s team. The company is on track to triple the size of its engineering team this year. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

The company’s leaders on Friday doubled down on its shift to a focus on digital assets during WisdomTree’s earnings call, reiterating its goal to bring fixed income, equities and commodities into the digital world through blockchain-enabled funds and tokenized exposures. “Crypto’s interesting, but the real opportunity is blockchain-enabled finance,” Chief Operating Officer Jarrett Lilien said during the call. “It’s a mistake to confuse crypto, which is a use case for the blockchain…with the broader opportunity we’re pursuing.” CEO Jonathan Steinberg said that in addition to dropping “Investments” from its name, the company would change its ticker from WETF to WT. Though the company has 78 ETFs trading in the US with roughly $52 billion in assets under management, according to ETF.com, the CEO said the adjustments were “a nod toward our natural evolution and history of innovation” as the company looks to expand. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The company’s assets under management dropped to about $71 billion in the third quarter — down 4.6% from the second quarter — due to market depreciation. It has since rebounded to nearly $75 billion, in part due to $1.8 billion in October net inflows. Its cryptoassets under management rose slightly from $151 million, as of June 30, to $163 million at the end of the third quarter. Net flows in the segment, which totaled $41 million in 2022, as of Sept. 30, were flat last quarter. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.06, which was in line with estimates. WisdomTree’s stock price, which is down about 16% year to date, was down 1.5% on the day at 12:30 pm ET. Blockchain-focused product development Executives said during the call that the company’s blockchain-native financial services mobile app , WisdomTree Prime, is in beta testing and is on track for a national rollout by the end of the first quarter of 2023. WisdomTree CEO Jonathan Steinberg said the company has so far spent roughly $20 million on its tokenization and WisdomTree Prime efforts. The company’s leaders declined to comment on the app’s number of beta users or transaction volumes so far. The firm also gained SEC approval to launch its Short-Term Treasury Digital Fund last month — an offering that digitizes its fund share ownership record on the Ethereum or Stellar blockchains. Executives have said the fund is a first step toward bringing traditional financial assets into the digital ecosystem and allowing blockchain rails to improve investor experience, such as through near-instant settlement finality. WisdomTree has filed for nine additional funds to be part of a blockchain-enabled fund suite that includes fixed income and equity strategies, executives revealed. Such offerings are expected to only be available via WisdomTree Prime initially, according to Will Peck, the firm’s head of digital assets. Journey to a US spot bitcoin ETF WisdomTree’s proposed US spot bitcoin ETF was rejected by the SEC last month, a familiar outcome for all asset managers who have sought to bring such a product to market. Grayscale Investments is moving forward with suing the SEC for denying the company’s proposal to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. Peck said Friday that the firm has no plans to join Grayscale’s lawsuit, adding WisdomTree would instead look to “work productively” with the SEC. “We know that regulatory concerns take time to address, and appreciate the due diligence in doing so,” Peck previously told Blockworks. “We acknowledge that this is a slow-moving process, and we aren’t letting that stop us from innovating in other ways in the meantime.” The company offers crypto ETPs, including a spot bitcoin product, in Europe.

        "text": "Count Silvergate Capital among the publicly-traded crypto names hit by plunging stock prices triggered by this week’s sudden market downturn. Silvergate, a digital assets-focused, registered US bank, has drawn the attention of Wall Street analysts, parsing the level of exposure the company had to the digital assets meltdown precipitated by FTX and Alameda Research. In a strained liquidity environment, financial services firms can be hard pressed to handle mounting withdrawal requests, as was the case with FTX. FTX is a Silvergate customer and the bank prominently displays a quote from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on the home page of its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), in which he calls the bank “one of the key backbones of the cryptocurrency settlement layer.” Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The bank offers institutional investors bitcoin-backed lending and says it maintains loan-to-value, or collateralization, levels, plus ample cash and short-dated securities like US Treasurys on hand, to permit its customers to cash out at any time. Even so, Silvergate’s stock plunged 23% Tuesday — and by almost 85% in the past year. Although customers have been able to make deposits and withdrawals without interruption, industry participants have posited the potential for a shift if market conditions worsen. John Popeo, a financial services regulation adviser, said “an uncomfortable topic for both crypto firms and traditional finance firms such as banks is the intersection of crypto and tradfi, and I think we’re going to have a lot more of those conversations as we move forward.” One source familiar with the matter said Silvergate’s balance sheet is “built” so they “don’t end up in a situation like some of the crypto industry players out there, where they have a liquidity crunch.” Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said in a statement that the regulated entity uses its balance sheet to “provide liquidity for our clients while maintaining a strong capital position in excess of the well-capitalized status required by federal banking regulations.” The source said Silivergate has a “highly liquid balance sheet” consisting of $1.5 billion in loans and an estimated $13.5 billion in liquid securities and cash. Silivergate stocks closed trading at $32.68 , down by $2.01 from the day before. Michael Bodley contributed reporting. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "text": "Crypto wallet maker Ledger is rolling out its crypto debit card across the UK and Europe, as a string of scandals in the ecosystem spurs interest in self-custody solutions. Ledger’s Crypto Life (CL) card allows users to move crypto between Ledger hardware wallets and card accounts via companion app Ledger Live. While the card supports the French firm’s cold crypto wallets — which promote self-custody — CL is developed by London-based fintech Baanx, which states that “it’s not a bank” on its website. Similar to other crypto cards already on offer, customers can earn 1% crypto rewards in bitcoin or USDT, or 2% in Baanx’s native token BXX, when funds are spent. Users can also receive paychecks denominated in bitcoin, ether or other stablecoins. Lithuanian banking-as-a-service provider Contis Financial handles custody of all funds kept on the card. Baanx’s website states that Contis Financial is authorized by the Lithuanian central bank, however card funds will not be covered by the country’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or Deposit Insurance System. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “No other compensation scheme exists to cover losses claimed in connection with the account and associated card,” Baanx says in an FAQ. “We will however ensure that any funds received by you are held in a segregated account so that should we become insolvent your funds will be protected against claims made by our creditors.” Like Mastercard, Visa supports crypto cards issued by several companies including Coinbase and Binance. Binance’s branded card is similar to Ledger’s — in fact it’s also managed by Contis — but the rewards are in BNB and held on the exchange. Ledger card promotes self-custody, until it’s time to spend crypto Ledger says it received over 400,000 waitlist signups for CL, after first announcing the program at the Ledger Op3n conference in Dec. 2021. Customers can use their cards at some 90 million merchants and online stores accepting Mastercard across the UK and Europe. “We now have an easy and secure solution to pay with crypto that also allows you to self-custody until you want to top up,” said JF Rochet, vice president of international development at Ledger. Ledger partner Baanx no doubt hopes adoption of the product might boost the price of its BXX token. The startup first sold BXX at $0.12 in an initial coin offering in 2019, with 56% of the supply designated for the public. BXX now trades for about $0.012 — down 90% from its initial sale price and 97% below its $0.40 record last October. The token boasts a meagre market value of $430,000 after jumping about 25% Thursday morning, a few hours ahead of the press release embargo. Crypto-compatible cards were also popular with ill-fated lending platforms Celsius, Voyager and BlockFi, with those products all directly threatened by their respective liquidity crises. Ledger’s card differs slightly in that Ledger users can directly transfer crypto from cold storage for spending and back again — rather than from centralized entity to card. The firm has claimed that 20% of all digital assets are held on Ledger devices. Sales for Ledger devices actually spiked following Celsius’ collapse as crypto investors rethought who they trust with their assets. In an email to Blockworks, a Ledger spokesperson said: “We warn customers every time they top up that the funds are no longer self-custodied on their Ledger, so ideally they would top up what they need to use, when they need to use it.” US-based Ledger users eager for a debit card will still have to wait a few months. A US rollout was earlier pegged for Q2 this year, however a spokesperson said it would arrive “in the coming months.” The US card will use Visa instead of Mastercard.

        "text": "Music NFTs are having a moment. From major record labels such as Warner Music Group to artists like Steve Aoki and 3LAU, the music industry is seeking opportunities to leverage Web3 to better monetize their work. Warner Music Group, also called WMG, announced a multi-year partnership with the LGND.io startup on Tuesday to launch a music NFT marketplace on the Ethereum-compatible Polygon proof-of-stake sidechain. Select WMG artists and creators will be chosen to drop songs as digital collectibles starting in January 2023, according to a statement from the company. The platform, called LGND Music, will be a mobile and desktop application that will reportedly support music NFTs or their so-called “Virtual Vinyls” from other blockchains as well. While iOS users will get to fully own their music tokens, their purchases on LGND’s iOS app will be subject to Apple’s 30% in-app purchase fee . Among the first artists featured on LGND Music are slated to include those represented by the WMG-owned electronic music label Spinnin’ Records. Steve Aoki and 3LAU The Web3 community loves its parties and DJs, and two of the most prolific electronic musicians — Steve Aoki and Justin “3LAU” Blau — fittingly announced that they will use their CryptoPunks NFTs as their alter egos to form a new group called Punx. Loading Tweet.. New music from the duo, who have been friends for 10 years, according to Aoki, will be released in 2023. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “This isn’t an NFT,” tweeted the pair, but rather Punx is described as a “conceptual music/art project” with a different sound than fans are used to from the musicians. Both Aoki and Blau changed their respective Twitter profile pictures to Punk #6748 and Punk #6708, respectively, signaling that these NFTs may be used as characters in music videos or other visual imagery. Another example of a duo using their NFTs for musical projects is Eminem and Snoop Dogg, who turned their Bored Apes into avatars for an MTV performance. Additionally, Bored Ape and Mutant Ape NFT characters have also been used to form a virtual band called Kingship under Universal Music Group’s 10:22PM label. Blau owns the music NFT marketplace Royal that allows users to own a piece of a song or album’s streaming royalty rights. While historically it has only worked with huge acts like Nas, Diplo and Chainsmokers, Royal has now started to give smaller, emerging artists the chance to sell percentages of streams of their songs in the form of tokens. Independent artist Jake Zimma released his first drop on Royal this week and sold out in two hours. He told Blockworks that this opportunity was a way to “not just grow financially but also a way to engage with fans and generate awareness of my music and brand.” “While the ups and downs of crypto currencies may be unpredictable, trends within musicians’ streaming behavior can easily be counted on,” Zimma said. “It’s an exciting new way for musicians and music fans to get involved with the crypto world, hopefully without as much chaos.” “At the end of the day everyone loves music,” he added. Windows’ Winamp MP3 player Another company trying to ride the music NFT wave is Winamp — Windows’ desktop media player from the ‘90s. Its latest update for desktop allows its 83 million users to play audio files embedded in their NFTs, tweeted Winamp — but it requires a few steps. Those with NFT music libraries on MetaMask would need to link their wallets via Brave, Chrome or Firefox browsers to import the files into Winamp as an .m3u playlist. Winamp supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 audio and video files and is compatible with Ethereum and Polygon NFTs. Winamp users’ responses on Twitter varied from “You lost me with NFTs” to “Lol. No” and “will try this new version.” Winamp CEO Alexandre Saboundjian stated that Winamp is the “the very first standalone player reading audio NFTs.” His plans also include launching a cross-platform creator service that links artists and fans directly in early 2023. Growth of music NFTs Music NFT marketplace Sound.xyz reported that the number of mints of NFTs has doubled in each of the last two months. Dune Analytics data showed that over a third — around 12,000, of the platform’s 30,000 mints came in November. And so far in December, there have already been more than 7,400 new mints, signaling the likelihood that the total mints will pass last month’s record. NFTs, whether music or art, enable creators to foster a community around their work built on ownership over their digital assets. Artists can earn royalties each time the NFT is sold, while collectors who also have a stake in ownership may gain exclusive access to shows, merch, meet and greets and more. Traditionally, the labels who represent these artists distribute their music to streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. A percentage of revenue from users who subscribe to these platforms is then redistributed among the label, artists and producers in the form of royalties. This model, however, is a “disaster,” according to Gino The Ghost, music producer and founder of music NFT project Blocktones. “Labels are making more [money] than ever before while signed artists and the creatives behind those records make pennies (of a penny) on the dollar…Spotify has yet to even turn a profit. Nobody wins,” he tweeted . Music NFTs provide a unique vehicle of distribution, he added , because it “allow artists to package their music in a non-conventional way. Set the supply, engage with your fans, and activate your community with future application.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The one-time Wall Street darling’s decline has outpaced dropping, and highly volatile, equity and spot cryptocurrencies markets this year. It’s now in a 66% hole from its all-time (split-adjusted) high of $414.50, set on Nov. 4, 2021. The epic fall of the electric carmaker mirrors that of bitcoin in 2022, up about 2.6% on the day as of 5 pm ET— but down 65% year to date. Bitcoin’s volatility of late has been remarkably muted, according to research firm BitOoda, which said in a Tuesday report that “a prolonged period below 200-day [exponential moving average] has built price stability to the downside, and BTC seems to have support at [$]16,000.” Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Tesla is the third-largest publicly traded company to hold BTC on its balance sheet, behind MicroStrategy (MSTR) and crypto miner Marathon Digital (MARA), and just ahead of Hut 8 Mining (HUT), according to BitcoinTreasuries . The performance of all four companies now lags that of the underlying spot bitcoin for the year for the first time since May. Just a week ago, markets were reacting positively to cooling inflation numbers in the US and a more measured interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. But Tesla did not participate in the short-lived rally, as the market weighed the impact of CEO Elon Musk’s Twitter quagmire . Last week, Musk sold $3.5 billion of his own stock, according to regulatory disclosures , further depressing sentiment. The stock has now neatly filled a two-year-old gap open from Nov. 17, 2020. Source: TradingView Tesla sold 75% of its bitcoin stash in the second quarter of 2022 but held the rest through the third quarter. The company is now down 52%, or about $174 million, on its crypto treasury bet. Its fourth quarter SEC disclosure is slated for late January 2023. Other crypto-linked public companies have fared poorly, as well. And that may be putting matters mildly. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) ended Tuesday on yet another all-time closing low at $34.97 — continuing their slide from last week . The stock is now 90% off its post-IPO high at the peak of the crypto bull market. Also down 90% from its highpoint is Musk’s crypto darling dogecoin (DOGE).

        "text": "key takeaways key takeaways Fund manager VanEck filed for its bitcoin trust  in December 2020, and the SEC has previously delayed making a decision on the product The SEC is “extremely unlikely” to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, according to CFRA’s head of ETF and mutual fund research The deadline for the SEC to rule on VanEck’s spot bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, with the agency’s 240-day review period expiring on November 14. The New York-based fund group filed for its bitcoin trust , which would invest directly in bitcoin, on December 30 of last year. A dozen or so other similar products sit alongside it in registration. As spot bitcoin ETFs await approval, the SEC allowed ProShares to launch a bitcoin futures ETF on October 19, and a similar fund by Valkyrie came to market three days later. Futures-based bitcoin offerings from VanEck and Global X are also expected to launch. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Though the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has grown to nearly $1.3 billion in assets under management, some industry watchers have said they expect investor demand for a spot bitcoin product to be much higher. A flood of filings for futures-based bitcoin ETFs came in August after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler implied during a virtual forum in August that the agency would favor ETFs filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which are limited to CME-traded bitcoin futures contracts. The SEC last week moved back the deadline to make a decision on the proposed Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund by 60 days — from November 8 to January 7, 2022. Valkyrie Funds CEO Leah Wald told Blockworks in an email that the delay was not surprising and was in line with interactions the firm has had with the SEC. “We believe this a positive step because it means the agency is taking the time to deliberate and wholly consider the merits of such a product coming to the market,” she said at the time. But the SEC, which has previously delayed its decision on VanEck’s proposal, must now approve or deny the product by November 14, industry professionals have explained. Loading Tweet.. The SEC is “extremely unlikely” to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. “The SEC continues to have concerns about fraud related to the cryptocurrency that are unlikely to be alleviated in the near term,” he told Blockworks. “I don’t have a forecast to when that will change.” James Seyffart, an ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday that though he believes the SEC should approve the proposed VanEck offering, he expects the agency to deny it. “But, the denial letter should give us insight into [the] SEC’s current views/opinions on [the] underlying bitcoin market,” he added. BlockFi and Neuberger Berman became the latest issuers looking to launch a bitcoin ETF. Bitwise Asset Management also recently filed to launch the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust, and the fund group published roughly 150 pages of data-driven research with the filing that sought to address SEC concerns. The firm published the research to put it on the record and have the SEC respond to it, said Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan said, adding that the agency’s response to the findings could move the industry forward. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said during a recent Blockworks podcast that he would estimate December 2022 as his “over-under” for a spot bitcoin ETF approval. Wald, who joined Balchunas on the podcast, noted that she believed it would be sooner. Kevin O’Leary, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist known widely outside the financial world for his appearances on ABC’s Shark Tank , told Blockworks in August that he doesn’t think the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF in the US until at least 2023. “I have no more information than anybody else — but I’ve listened to the regulator trying to read the tea leaves,” O’Leary said at the time. “I think they’re going to go slowly into this.” Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

        "title": "Robinhood Sells Your Data, but Does That Matter?",
        "url": "https://blockworks.co/news/robinhood-sells-your-data-but-does-that-matter",
        "text": "Shooters shoot. Traders trade. And Robinhood sells your data. Word on the street says retail can now move the market. The argument goes like this: Retail traders are bored (quarantine) with money on their hands (stimulus) and more powerful and cheaper tools than ever before (Robinhood). A research paper titled A Requiem for the Retail Investor found that “In 1950, retail investors owned over 90% of the stock of U.S. corporations. [As of 2009], retail investors own less than 30% and represent a very small percentage of U.S. trading volume. In a more recent study run by New York University economist Edward Wolff, Wolff found that “More than 93 percent of the stock is owned by the top 20 percent of households. The bottom 80 percent of households own only about 7 percent.” This doesn’t necessarily mean that retail is dead though. Spend one day on FinTwit and you’ll quickly see otherwise. TD Ameritrade disclosed a record 608,000 new funded accounts for Q1, as well as more than 3x the number of users in March 2020 compared to March 2019. Brokerages like Schwab, Fidelity and E*Trade also reported record new users. Without casinos and sports, gamblers are moving into the stock market. With returns of 7,000% in two weeks, equities like GameStop are providing plenty of reason. So retail is alive and well, but back to the original question… does it drive the market? This is where it gets tricky. You see, Robinhood sells the retail order flow to high-frequency traders [HFTs] and big hedge funds like Citadel. These traders could then use HFT algorithms to front run the trades, which would massively accentuate the retail momentum. In reality, it’s much more nuanced than this.  There is an entire business around selling order book data, but it might not actually be a bad thing for consumers. Quick Background on Robinhood Robinhood was founded in April 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who had previously built high-frequency trading platforms for financial institutions in New York City. In December 2013, Robinhood raised a $3M seed round. Now, just seven years after launching, Robinhood has raised $1.2B and has over 10M users. Roughly 80% of Robinhood’s customers are millennials and the average customer age is just 26, according to the Wall Street Journal. Robinhood’s marketing pitch is that you can trade for free. So how does this thriving company actually make money? Payment for Order Flow Claiming that popular companies make money by selling consumers’ data has been all the rage for several years now. Remember this phrase? Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe “If You’re Not Paying for the Product, You are the Product.” Well, it turns out that still exists. Twitter users were outraged this past week when they heard that Robinhood makes money by selling users’ trading data to high frequency trading firms. If you’re a Robinhood user, your blood pressure may have gone up a few notches when you realized that more sophisticated investors than yourself are front running your trades. Let’s slow down though and zoom out. Robinhood does indeed make money, in part, by sending customer orders to high-frequency traders in exchange for cash. But so does everyone else! This practice is called “payment for order flow”, or PFOF for short. It’s a common practice among brokerages such as TD Ameritrade, Schwab, and E*Trade. Though Robinhood has faced the most criticism for its PFOF business, which was up 227% in 2018, in reality, nearly every brokerage has been selling their customers’ orders to market makers like Virtu, Two Sigma, and Citadel for years. Based on historical numbers, Robinhood’s PFOF business probably brings in around $150 million to $250 million annually. Why Do Market Makers Want Robinhood’s Data? Market makers make money on the spread between the bid and the ask. They provide liquidity to the market, which means they take the other side of trades. When a sophisticated institutional investor, such as a large hedge fund, come to a market maker, this can be risky for the market maker. If the hedge fund is selling a large volume of securities, there’s probably a good reason for it. If the market maker takes the other side of the trade and buys the securities that the hedge fund is selling, there’s a decent chance that the market will keep moving in the hedge fund’s favor. This exposes the market maker to downside risk. With retail traders though, it’s virtually impossible for this to happen. Retail traders, by virtue of them being retail, don’t trade in large sizes nor do they coordinate with other retail traders. They’re generally less sophisticated than institutional traders so for a market maker, it’s rare that you’ll lose money on making a market for retail traders. Basically, it’s more profitable and risk free to make markets for retail as compared to institutional. In fact, Virtu—one of largest market makers—executed nearly 25 percent of retail shares for S&P 500 securities with orders between 100 and 1,999 shares in January, putting its market share behind only Citadel ( S&P Global ). So, trading firms are taking retail orders from Robinhood. But they’re not doing anything illegal. They’re simply doing what they’re supposed to do: providing liquidity and making markets. In fact, the market making firms like Citadel and Virtu are one of the reasons why Robinhood users can place trades for free. Less than 50% of Robinhood’s Revenue Comes from PFOF According to a Bloomberg report last year, Robinhood brought in around 40 percent of its revenue in 2018 from selling its customers’ orders to market makers. So what makes up the 60 percent? A combination of a subscription service called Robinhood Gold (because when in Silicon Valley, we must have recurring revenues…), net interest from cash deposits, and income from lending stocks purchased on margin. We don’t need to discuss Robinhood Gold much because it’s simple to understand. For $5/month, you get access to “Morningstar research reports, NASDAQ Level II Market Data, bigger instant deposits, and margin investing.” Income from lending stocks purchased on margin probably makes up a decent chunk of Robinhood’s revenue, but it’s really the net interest from cash deposits that brings home the bacon for Robinhood This is a good time to remind you that we don’t have access to any Robinhood data that you don’t have. These are predictions based on public data. Robinhood is notoriously private about their numbers. Net Interest Margin Patrick McKenzie has the best description of the net interest margin business: Suppose I were to give you $100, in return for your promise to give it back when I wanted it and pay me 0.27% annualized interest in the meanwhile. Suppose you invested this in a virtually riskless bond, perhaps a mortgage-backed security with government backing, offering 2.53% annualized interest. You’d earn $2.26 in net interest in a year. Suppose I were to give you $200 billion dollars. Now I’m the American middle class and you’re Charles Schwab. You would earn something like $5.8 billion dollars in net interest income. This would entirely pay for your sideline business in running a brokerage. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, branch offices, call centers, blah blah blah, it all exists to justify the only pricing page that matters, and all the verbiage on the pricing page is about how much you pay the customer. This is an exaggeration, but not much of one. 57% of Schwab’s revenues are from net interest. The firm could literally give away every other service; discount the mutual fund fees to zero, do away with commissions, etc etc, and they would still be profitable. Schwab isn’t even the leader among discount brokerages in dependence on net interest. That would be E*TRADE, at about 67% of revenues. Interactive Brokers makes 49% and TD Ameritrade 51% in the segment. Did you get that? No? Okay, let’s let Patrick carry on. Some people get mad about the financial industry for taking advantage of customers. I find it hard to get mad about a deal between willing counterparties, but if you think that Wall Street is soaking the US middle class, you should be monomanically focused on the interest spread between cash balances in brokerage accounts and high-interest bank accounts or money market funds. That is the cost that does not call itself a cost. Brokerage customers keep ~10% of their assets in cash. The 200 basis point spread between cash in brokerage accounts and money market funds or insured bank accounts, all of which are functionally riskless, is equivalent to a 20 bps asset management fee across the portfolio. Vanguard’s flagship funds charge about 10 bps for wrapping the entire stock market, SPY (an ETF, which structurally has lower costs) does it for 4 bps, and people think the roboadvisors might be expensive doing similar for 25 bps on top of the underlying investments… and the discount brokerages charge effectively 20 bps over all your assets just for managing the tiny portion that is in cash, the easiest asset to manage. But instead people get mad about payment for order flow, because nobody writes books about Interest Rate Spreads Are Just Too Darn High. To summarize, brokerages like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E*Trade make 50-70% of their revenue from their net interest margin. This is the spread between what the brokerage pays their customers on their cash versus what the brokerage can earn on its investments in 2-year U.S. Treasuries. Net interest margin is how Robinhood makes money. Conclusion The media loves to spin the story that the fictional character Robinhood stole from the rich and gave to the poor and that the fintech app Robinhood sells data from the poor so the rich get richer. Today, it’s never looked more like that is actually the case. At its core, Robinhood is just a computer program that moves money around. It puts a sleek user interface over an API to the financial markets, allowing retail investors to buy $100 worth of Apple. But as soon as Robinhood caved to Citadel and prohibited their users from selling stocks like GameStop or AMC, they became a part of the problem.  You could even argue that they violated their fiduciary duty."

But without the approval of a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund, RIA’s are having a hard time getting their collective $4 trillion in retail assets into digital currencies. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe Most RIA’s collect an asset management fee based on the value of their client’s account. Advisors custody client assets to a firm, like TD Ameritrade or Charles Schwab Corp., where they serve as the brokerage platform for the buying and selling of securities based on instructions from the investment advisor. Because Bitcoin and other digital tokens are not securities, they are not available on most custodial platforms. “If a platform does not allow us to buy bitcoin, then I have to move that money somewhere else,” said Ric Edelman, founder of RIA Digital Assets Council, with more than $200 billion in assets under management, in a recent Blockworks webinar . “And the ‘somewhere else’ may not facilitate our ability to collect the fee that we would otherwise collect from the client’s account.” Increased investor demand, combined with strict regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission, has led to the creation of a variety of ETF-adjacent investment vehicles, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) and the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (ticker BITW). These products are structured similarly to an ETF in that they trade like stocks, but they come with high premiums, which go toward custody and security costs. A Bitcoin ETF, in contrast, would trade at net asset value, meaning investors would not have to pay extra for digital asset exposure. “ETFs are very familiar to both advisors and their clients, they are low in cost, they have maximum liquidity and they are regulated by the SEC,” said Edelman. “The familiarity alleviates many uncertainties that advisors and their clients would otherwise have regarding digital assets.” The SEC has denied every past bid for a Bitcoin ETF, but some are betting that a change in leadership, coupled with broader institutional acceptance, will lead to a more positive crypto sentiment. VanEck Associates Corp. filed for the VanEck Bitcoin Trust in December 2020, making the firm the latest to attempt a Bitcoin ETF launch. “The market has done a tremendous 180 on their stance on Bitcoin and cryptos and I think you’re going to see that there is still a lot of interest that is going to grow in the entire crypto market,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. “There is now a belief that this is not going away anytime soon and there is no doubt that blockchain is here to stay.” Chris King, founder and CEO of Eaglebrook Advisors, is betting that we won’t see a crypto ETF until 2022, pointing out that the regulated exchanges will need to see a major increase in volume before an ETF can be priced and come to market. “But, by that point, I think everyone in the crypto space thinks that bitcoin is going to be a lot higher, so you really need to find an investment product that works for you now,” said King."

Leveraging his connections in the space, Estes set up a relationship with the trustee and began identifying claimants in need of liquidity who were willing to sell.  Off the Chain’s cost basis on these claims is roughly $1,000, a return of more than 700%. Off the Chain and Fortress are the only buyers of these claims, with Estes’ firm purchasing two thirds of all claims sold.  The lack of buyers is  due to the difficulty and cost of establishing a relationship with the Japanese trustee. Fortress allegedly spent an estimated $700,000 in legal fees developing that relationship. Off the Chain revealed to Blockworks that other investment strategies include buying discounted future Bitcoin from miners and packaging up Bitcoin to be sold for a premium in brokerage accounts. Private Equity Portfolio Outside of Bitcoin, Estes’ fund is a prolific buyer of private shares in crypto companies, such as Coinbase, Kraken and investment giant DCG.  The fund looks for motivated sellers looking for liquidity that are willing to sell at a discount of 50% or higher. According to Estes, Off the Chain owns 1% of BitPay and 1% of Polychain Capital, purchased from one of the early employees. Today, Off the Chain’s portfolio consists of 70% securitized blockchain assets, 15% in Mt. Gox claims, and 15% in private equity.  In the future, Estes is trying to reduce the holdings of securitized assets to 50% and increase Mt. Gox claims and private securities accordingly. Despite a successful track record and increased institutional interest, the fundraising environment was challenging for Estes. “I’ve done a lot of fundraises before, and this was the hardest fundraise I’ve ever done in 30 years.  It was like pulling teeth.” The fund didn’t succeed at attracting any institutional interest, although Estes was quick to mention the high quality high-net-worth individuals he counts in his LP base. This includes three pre-IPO Goldman Sachs partners, a Co-founder of Fortress, a former president of Morgan Stanley, and a former SEC commissioner among others. According to Estes, Bitcoin’s rally has made fundraising much easier in recent months."

        "text": "Bitcoin and crypto are no longer obscure internet phenomena. Over the past decade, they have become a critical alternative asset class that impacts nearly every institution in the world. At Blockworks, we’ve been helping investors understand this emerging asset class for nearly three years. Today, Blockworks is excited to announce the launch of our editorial site. Leveraging our new site and daily newsletter , our editorial team will focus on the asset managers, companies, and individuals that shape the crypto industry. Newsletter Subscribe to Blockworks Daily Subscribe The goal of our editorial team is simple: to provide investors and finance professionals with the news, analysis, and insights they need to make informed decisions about the digital asset space. What you can expect: As an independently-owned company that has never raised venture money, coverage from Blockworks will have no agenda. We pledge to report on the industry in a way that is unbiased, fact-based and accessible. We will dutifully cover markets, investment trends, and regulatory developments that connect the emerging crypto ecosystem with the broader world of macro finance. Why now? Bitcoin has emerged as a non-sovereign, global, decentralized, digital store of value. The industry is experiencing record institutional inflows, from macro hedge funds, to university endowments, to RIAs. This transformation is happening at one of the most uncertain moments in the history of our global financial system. In a three month time span in 2020, central banks printed $25 trillion. Corporate and sovereign debt levels are at all time highs, interest rates are at all time lows, and inequality is increasing faster than ever before. If we’ve learned one thing in 2020, it’s that the “old way” of doing things isn’t working. We’re entering into a new world of finance, and Blockworks is here to help you navigate it.
