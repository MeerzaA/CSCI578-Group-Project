            "text": "As you\u2019ve commented, NIST has been working on QR (quantum resistant) asymmetric cryptography for years now, and even adopted 3 candidate algorithms. The problem is the implementation is still clunky. Unlike ECDSA (which Ethereum and Bitcoin are based on) it\u2019s much slower, and creating private keys is more involved.\n\nTo upgrade e.g. Ethereum to use e.g the Falcon algorithm, you\u2019ll need to do one of 2 things: update the base cryptography of the blockchain, essentially creating a new blockchain everyone needs to migrate to (and I do mean every wallet, smart contract, pool, token etc.), or adopt Abstracted Accounts that use Falcon to secure your funds, and then use the existing ECDSA to transfer them.\n\nBoth ideas have been floated and researched. Idea 1 is too big - essentially means relaunching Ethereum- and it would be slower and clunkier (until better implementations of Falcon are produced). Idea 2 is what Vitalik has been pushing for 2 years now. Account Abstraction (AA) makes a lot of sense, requires no major infrastructure changes, and has plenty of other benefits (check out ERC-4337). But because of gas concerns, and slow public uptake, only a few protocols and dApps picked it up. My guess is the adoption rate of AAs will start growing in coming years.\n\nIf you were to build a new blockchain today, you could (should) make its core cryptography QR. It may be slower (for now) but safer.\n\nFinal thought: everyone in the crypto world is terrified of quantum computers stealing their funds. But if a quantum machine appears one day, able to crack cryptographic algorithms, it will be used on better targets than cryptocurrencies. Banks, companies, money transfer systems - have way more value than all of crypto combined. Heck, the first thing to go will be SSL - no more web security, no more encrypted internet (there is a QR version of SSL, and it even exists in Chrome, but every web server in the world will need to adopt it, and it is, at the risk of repeating myself, quite slow)."

This shift occurred after a 10% increase in USDT supply on Ethereum, reaching $60.3 billion, while Tron's supply fell to $58.1 billion. Ethereum now holds a 45.4% share of USDT dominance compared to Tron's 43.7%. The increase in USDT supply, now at an all-time high of $132.9 billion, is seen as a positive indicator for trading liquidity in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

This move follows a significant rise in Bitcoin's price, partly due to increased interest from institutional investors like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, who are treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The withdrawals suggest growing confidence in Bitcoin, potentially leading to supply issues and further price increases as demand continues to rise.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

A CryptoQuant report indicates that whale purchases reached $1.5 billion, excluding coins in centralized exchanges. For Bitcoin to break its all-time high, retail participation needs to increase.

With 13,000 BTC\u2014around a third of its GDP\u2014Bhutan's holdings are more than double those of El Salvador, despite having a population just 1/8th the size. The country began mining Bitcoin in 2019 using clean hydropower, positioning itself ahead of the game in sustainable crypto mining. While the world focused on El Salvador's flashy Bitcoin moves, Bhutan worked quietly on building the largest mining site by 2021, showing a long-term, strategic approach. Rather than just holding Bitcoin for speculation, Bhutan uses it as a real revenue stream, making them the true \"crypto degen\" in a much more calculated way. The reason they don\u2019t get as much attention is likely because of their low-profile approach and small size, but their method could serve as a model for integrating Bitcoin into a national economy sustainably.."

I have zero interest in any other coin, because I am happy with my Bitcoin returns and I can't be bothered to pick anything new. Bitcoin is perfect. I don't even need to invest in Bitcoin anymore. My last purchase was in Nov 2022 when FTX imploded. Prices were too tempting to stay away. That said, what I have invested has grown more than what I expected, and it will grow even further from here on out. I need to now figure out what I want to do with my life, and find the courage to walk away from a 20 year successful corporate career.\n\nThese are the 100 I have tracked in my spreadsheet - \n\nTether USDT\nBitcoin BTC\nEthereum ETH\nRipple XRP\nMonero XMR\nDash DASH\nZcash ZEC\nLitecoin LTC\nNEM XEM\nFactom FCT\nNext NXT\nMaidSafeCoin MAID\nPeercoin PPC\nGolem GNT\nSteemnSTEEM\nSiacoin SC\nBurst BURST\nReddCoin RDD\nDogecoin DOGE\nGridCoin GRO\nNovacoin NVC\nNamecoin NMC\nLumen XLM\nBitcoin Cash BCC/BCH\nAdEx ADX\nOmiseGo OMG\nNEO NEO\nNeoGas GAS\nBinance Coin BNB\nLISK LSK\nPower Ledger POWR\nFinom FINOM\nNVC Token NVCET\nNMC Token NMCET\nBitcoin Diamond BCD\nMIOTA JOTA\nVeChain VEN\nTRON TRX\nEinsteinium EMC2\nBitcoin X BCX\nSuper Bitcoin SBTC\nCardano ADA\nVerge XVG\nSALT SALT\nZClassic ZCL\nAppCoins APPC\nEOS EOS\nBasic Attention Token BAT\nBitcoin Gold BTG\nStratis STRAT\nOntology ONT\nBlockMason Credit Protocol BCPT\nIGNIS IGNIS\nEOS Network EON\n ADD ADD\nMEETONE MEETONE\nAtidiurn ATD\nEOSpace EOP\nEveripedia IQ\nVeChain VET\nVTHO VTHO\nONG ONG\nHOARD HOARD\nWazirX WRX\nBitcoin SV BSV\nUniswap UNI\nUSDC USDC\nAAVE AAVE\nDENT DENT\nHBAR HBAR\nSXP SXP\nDOT DOT\nZRX ZRX\nKNC KNC\n1INCH 1INCH\nATOM ATOM\nBAKE BAKE\nBAL BAL\nCAKE CAKE\nCOMP COMP\nCTSI CTSI\nCVC CVC\nDATA DATA\nGO GO\nIDEX IDEX\nKAVA KAVA\nKSM KSM\nLINK LINK\nLRC LRC\nLUNA LUNA\nMATIC MATIC\nMKR MKR\nONE ONE\nREN REN\nSOL SOL\nSUSHI SUSHI\nXTZ XTZ\nSHR SHR\nPORTO PORTO\nSANTOS SANTOS"

The report notes that most coins sold are relatively new, with significant activity from mid-term investors. The profit distribution varies, with both small and high-return holders cashing in. Despite aggressive selling, the market shows signs of supply overhang, suggesting a potential need for re-accumulation as Bitcoin's price continues to rise.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

It\u2019s because there\u2019s constant buy pressure from ETF\u2019s and other institutional vehicles (like MSTR).\n\nImagine a small ecosystem of 10 investors. 5 are retail. 5 are institutional.\n\nThe 5 institutional buyers keep buying no matter what. Their investment horizon is 5+ years. They just keep buying.\n\nThe 5 retail buyers fluctuate. Sometimes they buy and sometimes they sell. But the moment they sell it all, they don\u2019t have more sell. \n\nSo now the 5 institutional investors end up pushing prices higher because they never stop buying and the scarcity goes up.\n\nThis is why when these retailers sell, they always complain prices go up. It\u2019s because once you sell, you no longer participate in the buy and sell cycle. There\u2019s only institutional buyers left and they keep pushing prices up.\n\nThe way to win in BTC is to think very long term. This is why MSTR\u2019s bond maturation is 5 years. They know they will hit the next BTC bull run in that time horizon."

            "text": "EDIT: HEADLINE PULLED OUT OF ASS! I've watched the whoe 18 min video, there is absolutely zaero predictions of 250K-500K bitcoin! (if anyone has actual source please link). So I was right with my skepticism (read below) as price predictions are totally unlike what Hosk talks abouts. However, the things he actually said there are way more exciting. He talks about implementing Minotaur with BITCOIN! OMG I've expected they iwll make their own PoW or merge with Ergo or something. But comboining Cardano's PoS security with BITCOIN's PoW security? That's soooo exciting, beyond my expectations. He also talked about implementing Bitcoin into CArdano's Lace wallet, where you could naturally and easily bridge the ecosystems, and allow DeFi on bitcoin! He also said the awesome overcryptocollaterialzed stablecoin DJED will also get Bitcoin collateral. That's also amazing!\n\nNow my initial reaction after I just read the headline, before watching his speech:\n\nSeriously? Common man, I love Cardano, and when Charles makes these educational technical blackboard vides, and sometimes some funny AMAs. On the other hands I'm not too much into his right-wing political rants, but predicting moons feels quite unlike him, did he really say that? I'mn gonna watch that speech to fact check what's it about, and in 10 minutes I'll edit what I actually head there. Becaume right now I've always seen him not caring about price predictions, he always says price goes up down and it has no effect on the actual tech, he of course celebrates when the price hits some nice high, but moon prediction? Well, I'm listening right now to see for myself if he really seriouly gonna say that there. Right now I kinda expect him to just jokingly say hey it might go to 250K or 500K or down, we dont know. I've never seen him seriously make price predictions and I listen to him a lot, so I'll see, listening right now, 14 minutes left."

This forecast is driven by increasing institutional investment and the potential growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, which could enhance its utility. Hoskinson views Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for governments and institutions, akin to gold. The crypto market has reacted positively to this prediction, with Bitcoin experiencing significant price fluctuations, and analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

            "text": "I've been saying this for months, but\u2026 this time it really is different.\n\nThe launch of the ETF has changed the game in ways we\u2019re only beginning to see, and if I\u2019m right, we won\u2019t fully understand the impact until the cycle plays out.\n\nMy gut feeling is that ETFs are adding stability to BTC. The days of massive 30\u201350% corrections might be behind us, especially as more and more people funnel into BTC via their retirement accounts. (Key word there: \"Retirement accounts\")\n\nThink about it: large swaths of the population are now holding BTC in their 401(k)s, which they can't touch until they're 55 or 59 \u00bd. So let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got a Gen X or Millennial in their early-to-mid 40s, with 10-15 years to go until retirement. They see the potential\u2014estimates of BTC hitting $1 million, or even $13 million, in the next 5\u201315 years\u2014and it starts to look like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with relatively low risk. They could drop $100k into BTC, and maybe make $1 million or more, without putting their 401k at risk. Especially since many are already 401(k) millionaires at this point.\n\nNow, take that thinking and apply it across the population. You\u2019ve got huge daily inflows of cash into BTC via ETFs, and those ETFs are gobbling up more BTC than miners can even produce\u2014something like 10x the amount being mined. The rest of that BTC is coming from the open market, and guess what? Those hardcore BTC maxis who said \u201ci\u2019Ll neVEr sEll\u201d are selling. But they\u2019re selling to BlackRock, Grayscale, MicroStrategy\u2026 big players who are now stacking more and more BTC.\n\nEventually, we\u2019re going to hit a point where there\u2019s just not enough BTC available on the open market to make a meaningful impact on the price\u2014except to push it higher. We\u2019re essentially seeing a lock-up of BTC in retirement accounts through ETFs. Sure, you can sell it, but why would you? Most people with 401(k)s don\u2019t pay attention to their accounts on a daily basis. They\u2019re just long-term holders by default. Plus, with trading restricted to market hours, and not being able to trade on weekends, this only further cements the \"HODL\" mentality for most of these accounts.\n\nSo yeah, when I say this time is different, I really do believe it. I think we\u2019ll still see corrections, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll see the huge dips we\u2019ve seen in the past\u2014at least not to the same degree.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just my take. Maybe it\u2019s fan fiction, who knows? But I\u2019m sticking to it."

If 10% of supply holders are getting out at or under $100k, then that's about 2 million BTC that has to move- or about 10 days if 100% of transactions are in this hypothetical scenario are people exiting the market. (Note, I just made up a number here.)\n\nThat also means there needs to be more buyers than that to keep the price up by the end of that sell run who will then push the price higher.\n\nIt did take about 8-10 days for the $68k-$70k barrier to be broken and 8-10 days for the $88k-$92k barrier to be broken, so I wouldn't be surprised if we're going to hold here for a bit as people who have \\~$100k as their sell price are exiting the market."

After a prolonged rally since September, the sentiment has cooled, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin nearly reached $100,000 but has stagnated around $99,800, with social sentiment dipping post-U.S. presidential election. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana show modest gains, smaller altcoins are gaining attention. The market's current phase reflects a temporary shift in focus, not a long-term bearish trend.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Forever! Gone, lost...\nBy the time we reach this last block, or by 2140, we easily could see only those last million BTC that will be mined in that period. \n\n\n\n\nLot of things can happen by then, forgotten wallet passwords, deaths, dementias, wars?\nBut maybe, he also left us that million that he mined in 2009. Maybe he programmed his wallet to release those BTC that he has on blockchain after 2140, or maybe sooner?\nAll those unknown whales that have 10k or more BTC on wallets since the genesis block, that could also be the Man himself. \n\n\n\n\nHe knew what he made, and he knew how it will blow in the future.\nHe's still out there, enjoying the fruits of his programming and other skills, and well deserved!"
